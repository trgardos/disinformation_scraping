"Research & Commentary: Anti-Economic Boycott Bill Will Protect Alabama Economy, Ensure Yellowhammer State Pension Funds Invested Appropriately",Tim Benson,"Legislation in the Alabama Senate (SB 261) would combat environmental, social and governance (ESG) scoring regimes by ensuring that taxpayer dollars do not fund commercial boycotts that reduce economic growth, cause job losses, and shrink Alabama’s tax base.

ESG scores are essentially a risk assessment mechanism increasingly being used by investment firms and financial institutions that forces large and small companies to focus upon politically motivated, subjective goals which often run counter to their financial interests and the interests of their customers. Companies are graded on these mandated commitments to promote, for example, climate or social justice objectives. Those that score poorly are punished by divestment and reduced access to credit and capital.

To combat this, the bill requires companies that contract with the state to certify that they do not boycott or discriminate against companies to achieve a radically progressive political agenda. Essentially, any business seeking to contract with the state cannot, “without an ordinary business purpose,” refuse to deal with, terminate business activities with, or take any commercial action that is “intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, limit commercial relations with, or change or limit the activities of a company because the company” because the company engages in certain activities.

These activities include “the exploration, production, utilization, transportation, sale, or manufacturing of fossil fuel-based energy, timber, mining, or agriculture,” or the “manufacture, import, distribution, marketing or advertising, sale, or lawful use of firearms, ammunition, or component parts and accessories of firearms or ammunition.”

Further, boycotts cannot be made of companies that “[do] not meet, [are] not expected to meet, or [do] not commit to meet environmental standards or disclosure criteria, in particular to eliminate, reduce, offset, or disclose greenhouse gas emissions,” or “employment or board composition, compensation, or disclosure criteria,” or don’t facilitate “access to abortion or sex or gender change surgery, medications, treatment, or therapies.”

The bill also prohibits any government entity in Alabama (“state agency, department, regulatory body, board, bureau, or commission, or any county, municipality, incorporated or unincorporated local government, or other political subdivision of the state”) from engaging in the same boycott and divestment strategies.

Critics of anti-ESG legislation have charged that bills such as Alabama’s SB 261 distort the free market and could possibly lower a state’s credit rating. However, the true distortion is being perpetrated by those seeking to use the financial agencies as de facto governmental regulators. By allowing ESG to gain a foothold in Alabama, Yellowhammer State legislators would be perpetuating this distorted marketplace, and nothing in the bill forces Alabama fiduciaries to use uneconomical investment options.

The collusion of corporations and institutions to boycott, divest from, or sanction any industry only hurts Alabama consumers and shareholders and could affect the long-term economic health of the state’s economy. By clarifying the fiduciary duties of Alabama’s pension fund managers by ensuring state funds don’t go to entities participating in and funding commercial boycotts, and by insisting that maximizing the return on investment for clients be their only guiding principle, Alabama legislators can help ensure the long-term fiscal health of both the Heart of Dixie’s pension systems and economy as a whole.

Research & Commentary: Anti-ESG Bill in North Carolina Will Ensure Tarheel State Pension Funds Invested Appropriately,"Tim Benson, Jack McPherrin","Legislation in the North Carolina House of Representatives (HB 750) would combat environmental, social and governance (ESG) scoring systems and ensure state pension funds are invested solely to achieve the maximum return on investment for pensioners, rather than advancing social or political causes that may likely lead to lower returns and financial underperformance.

ESG scores are essentially a risk assessment mechanism increasingly being used by investment firms and financial institutions that forces large and small companies to focus upon politically motivated, subjective goals which often run counter to their financial interests and the interests of their customers. Companies are graded on these mandated commitments to promote, for example, climate or social justice objectives. Those that score poorly are punished by divestment and reduced access to credit and capital.

To combat this, HB 750 states that any fiduciaries’ “evaluation of an investment, or evaluation or exercise of any right appurtenant to an investment, shall take into account only pecuniary factors. Plan fiduciaries are not permitted to promote non-pecuniary benefits or any other non-pecuniary goals. Environmental, social, corporate governance, or other similarly oriented considerations are pecuniary factors only if they present economic risks or opportunities that qualified investment professionals would treat as material economic considerations under generally accepted investment theories. The weight given to those factors shall solely reflect a prudent assessment of their impact on risk and return. Fiduciaries considering environmental, social, corporate governance, or other similarly oriented factors as pecuniary factors are also required to examine the level of diversification, degree of liquidity, and the potential risk-return in comparison with other available alternative investments that would play a similar role in their plans’ portfolios. Any pecuniary consideration of environmental, social, or governance factors shall necessarily include evaluating whether greater returns can be achieved through investments that rank poorly on these factors.”

As Heritage Action for America notes, “using asset managers that engage and vote shares based on ESG can reduce the value of pension fund assets over the long-term. For example, [the world’s largest investment firm] Blackrock has voted against directors for failing to set emissions reduction targets or for increasing exposure to fossil fuel assets such as coal. In 2020, Blackrock voted against the directors of a utility for increasing its exposure to coal related assets, even though such exposure would no doubt have been financially beneficial. Such actions prevent companies from making money during periods when being anti-ESG is profitable. Over time, this will reduce the value of pension fund assets.”

HB 750 further provides that proxy voting must be directed or exercised by a representative of the fiduciary in accord with the provisions of this law. Currently, only two firms—Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis—control 97 percent of the proxy advisory market and have stridently committed to ESG principles.



ISS and Glass Lewis are currently under scrutiny by several state attorneys general for collusion and antitrust violations.

Critics of anti-ESG legislation have charged that bills such as North Carolina’s HB 750 distort the free market and could possibly lower a state’s credit rating. However, the true distortion is being perpetrated by those seeking to use the financial agencies as de facto governmental regulators. By allowing ESG to gain a foothold in North Carolina, Tarheel State legislators would be perpetuating this distorted marketplace, and nothing in the bill forces North Carolinian fiduciaries to use uneconomical investment options.

By clarifying the fiduciary duties of North Carolina’s pension fund managers, and by insisting that maximizing the return on investment for clients be their only guiding principle, Old North State legislators can help ensure the long-term fiscal health of the state’s pension systems and make sure that promises proffered to state pensioners will be kept.

Energy at a Glance: Fracking for Oil and Natural Gas,Linnea Lueken,"For the full PDF of this policy tip sheet, click here.

Quick Bullets:

Fracking is a method of increasing the amount of oil and gas that can be extracted from a reservoir.

Fracking, combined with directional drilling, allowed U.S. natural gas production to climb 84 percent, and oil production to grow 137 percent.

The amount of new gas produced by fracking decreased the price of natural gas by $6.83/MCF from 2008 to 2020.

Research indicates fracking is not causing water or air pollution, or damaging earthquakes.

Hydraulic fracturing, aka “fracking,” is a method for recovering oil and gas from unconventional fossil fuel reservoirs. It involves creating fissures in a rock formation in order to stimulate oil or gas movement through a reservoir that may otherwise have been difficult to extract fluids from.

Two broad concepts need to be understood: “porosity” and “permeability.” Porosity exists when there is void space between grains of the rock, allowing fluid like gas, water, or oil, to accumulate. Permeability describes the presence of pathways between the spaces, which allow fluids to move through the rock.

For example, shale has good porosity, but poor permeability. As a result, it is hard to produce significant amounts of oil and gas from shale formations. The solution is to create artificial permeability by fracturing the rock. This is typically accomplished by pumping liquid solutions at high pressure down to the target formation, which opens cracks in—or fractures—the rock. The liquid contains what is called a “proppant,” which is often sand, in order to hold the new fissures open.","April 26, 2023",PUBLICATION,Heartland,https://heartland.org/publications/energy-at-a-glance-fracking-for-oil-and-natural-gas/
"Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Scores: A Threat to Individual Liberty, Free Markets, and the U.S. Economy",Jack McPherrin,"Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scoring systems have rapidly become one of the more polarizing issues in the United States. Over the past half-decade, the economies of most sovereign states—especially those in the Anglosphere—have been rapidly transformed, with wealth, power, and influence becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of a select few oligarchic individuals and institutions promoting ESG and their new economic ideology of “stakeholder capitalism.” As a result, ESG has become one of the gravest threats facing the free societies of the world today.

At its core, ESG is a social credit scoring system that ideologically aligned elites and subservient bureaucratic authorities have developed to “reset” the global financial system to their advantage, fundamentally transforming society in the process. This is accomplished by altering traditional frameworks of evaluating businesses and assessing investment risk. Rather than determining the credit-worthiness and value of a business or industry based upon objective measures such as profit, return on investment, consumer demand, and other material performance measures, ESG’s architects seek to judge entities based upon subjective and difficult to quantify social and environmental goals. These objectives typically have little or nothing to do with business success in the marketplace based on consumer demand expressed through their purchases.

Entities deemed unworthy, such as those involved in the hydrocarbon extraction business, firearm manufacturing, or even agricultural production, are being frozen out of financial markets and denied access to basic financial services. This restricts their access to investment infusion, loans, insurance policies, and other factors, while also limiting growth potential, restricting the ability to hire qualified workers, and forcing the reallocation of funds away from purchasing goods and services used as inputs for manufacturing, stock, and inventory in favor of subjective political goals. ESG’s ultimate goal is to transform the global economy by fundamentally altering the free marketplace, by limiting supply of goods that consumers demand, and socially engineering consumers to demand different products.

This paper offers a sweeping overview and comprehensive assessment of ESG. It outlines ESG’s historical roots, details a sample of commonly utilized ESG metrics, reveals ESG’s primary architects and overseers, analyzes the myriad deleterious consequences of ESG, and gives a detailed analysis of how new ESG mandates in the European Union will have drastic consequences for American society. Moreover, the paper discusses current anti-ESG policy solutions being orchestrated at multiple levels of government, and proposes a set of concrete policy recommendations for state and federal lawmakers.

Make no mistake: ESG is one of the most dangerous threats to American society that we have ever faced, from both an economic and ideological perspective. Time is running out to stop it in its tracks. However, there are solutions. Read on to educate yourself on the inherent dangers ESG propagates and the steps we can take to prevent its permeation of our country.

Research & Commentary: EPA Finds Greenhouse Gas Emissions Continue to Decline Despite Soaring Oil and Gas Production,Tim Benson,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2023 Draft Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) was released in early March, revealing total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States were 2 percent below their 1990 levels in 2021, falling from a high of 15.7 percent above 1990 levels in 2007.

According to the GHGI, all GHG emissions have fallen 15 percent since 2005, while carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions have fallen 18 percent, methane emissions have decreased 8 percent, and power-sector CO 2 emissions have fallen 36 percent over that same period. This has occurred while natural gas production has increased by 97 percent, natural gas-fired electric generation has increased 108 percent, and natural gas consumption has increased by 39 percent.

Oil production has also increased 53 percent since 1990, and methane emissions from the oil and gas industries, specifically, have fallen 13 percent over the same period, including a 4 percent reduction since 2020.

All of this is a direct result of the hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) revolution that has made accessible large natural gas and oil reserves and transformed the country’s energy outlook over the past 18 years.

Quite simply, despite opposition from environmental groups, who have attempted to ban fracking at every opportunity, the industry has transformed the nation’s long-term energy outlook. Moreover, its gradual replacement of coal in the country’s energy portfolio is the main driver of these dramatic reductions in GHG emissions.

Not only is fracking helping reduce GHG emissions, it is also providing large economic benefits to local communities located near drilling activities. A study published in the American Economic Review in April 2017 found, “each million dollars of new [oil and gas] production produces $80,000 in wage income and $132,000 in royalty and business income within a county. Within 100 miles, one million dollars of new production generates $257,000 in wages and $286,000 in royalty and business income.”

Fracking delivers $1,300 to $1,900 in annual benefits to local households, including, “a 7 percent increase in average income, driven by rises in wages and royalty payments, a 10 percent increase in employment, and a 6 percent increase in housing prices,” according to a December 2016 study conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago, Princeton University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

“Fossil fuels have benefited human health by making possible the dramatic increase in human prosperity that has occurred since the first Industrial Revolution, which made possible investments in goods and services that are essential to protecting human health and prolonging human life,” conclude the authors of a 2018 Heartland Institute Policy Brief. “Fossil fuels further improve human health by making environmental protection both valued and financially possible, and by powering technologies that protect human health and extend lives, including electricity, cars and trucks, and plastics.”

Fracking enables the cost-effective extraction of once-inaccessible oil and natural gas deposits. These energy sources are abundant, inexpensive, environmentally safe, and can ensure the United States remains a leading energy producer well beyond the twenty-first century. Therefore, policymakers should refrain from placing unnecessary burdens on the natural gas and oil industries, which are safe and have a positive impact on the environment and economy.

What If…Hydraulic Fracturing Were Banned? (2020 Edition)

https://www.globalenergyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2019-12/hf_ban_report_final.pdf

This study from the Global Energy Institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says a ban on fracking in the United States would be catastrophic for our economy. Their analysis shows that if such a ban were imposed in 2021, by 2025 it would eliminate 19 million jobs and reduce U.S. Gross Domestic Product by $7.1 trillion. Tax revenue at the local, state, and federal levels would decline by nearly a combined $1.9 trillion. Natural gas prices would leap by 324 percent, causing household energy bills to more than quadruple. By 2025, motorists would pay twice as much at the pump for gasoline as oil prices spike to $130 per barrel, while less domestic energy production would also mean less energy security.

https://www.api.org/~/media/Files/Oil-and-Natural-Gas/Hydraulic-Fracturing/2020/fracking-ban-study-americas-progress-at-risk.pdf

The study from the American Petroleum Institute (conducted by economic modeling firm OnLocation) warns that banning federal leasing and fracking on public and private lands, which some presidential candidates have proposed, would cost up to 7.5 million American jobs in 2022 alone, lead to a cumulative GDP loss of $7.1 trillion by 2030, slash household incomes by $5,400 annually, increase household energy costs by more than $600 per year and reduce farm incomes by 43 percent due to higher energy costs. If a ban is enacted, the U.S. would flip from being a net exporter of oil and petroleum products to importing more than 40 percent of supplies by 2030.

Geothermal energy comes from deep earth heat that remains from the formation of the planet, as well as ongoing radioactive decay inside the earth’s mantle. The high temperatures form magma, which heats surrounding rock in the crust. This natural heat of the earth is most easily available for use when it comes closer to the surface as hot springs, geysers, lava pits, underground hot water or steam reservoirs, and some high temperature dry rock reservoirs.

These kinds of conditions are most often found in tectonic plate boundary regions, like the Western United States, as seen in Figure 1 below, or in geologic “hot spots” of geothermal activity like Hawaii.","March 2, 2023",PUBLICATION,Heartland,https://heartland.org/publications/energy-at-a-glance-understanding-geothermal-power/
"Research & Commentary: Anti-Economic Boycott Bill Will Protect Iowa Economy, Ensure Hawkeye State Pension Funds Invested Appropriately",Tim Benson,"Legislation in the Iowa Senate would combat environmental, social and governance (ESG) scoring regimes by ensuring that taxpayer dollars do not fund commercial boycotts that reduce economic growth, cause job losses, and shrink Iowa’s tax base.

ESG scores are essentially a risk assessment mechanism increasingly being used by investment firms and financial institutions that forces large and small companies to focus upon politically motivated, subjective goals which often run counter to their financial interests and the interests of their customers. Companies are graded on these mandated commitments to promote, for example, climate or social justice objectives. Those that score poorly are punished by divestment, reduced access to credit and capital, and a refusal from state and municipal governments to contract with them.

As SSB 1094 notes, “The general assembly is deeply concerned over the increased prevalence of investing based on social and environmental factors…rather than pecuniary factors. Therefore, the general assembly intends to ensure that state funds and funds administered by the state, including public employee retirement funds, are protected from political influence detrimental to the financial health of the state and its citizens and promote the general assembly’s goal of protecting free enterprise.”

To combat this, the bill requires companies that contract with the state to certify that they do not boycott or discriminate against companies to achieve a radically progressive political agenda.

The bill would set up a list of “scrutinized companies,” which engage in “nonpecuniary social investment on behalf of a public entity or a boycott of certain companies on behalf of a public entity.” Further, the bill states that by March 2024, “a public fund shall make its best efforts to identify or have identified any scrutinized company that the public fund has entered into a contract with to provide investment or management of securities services for the public fund” and ensure these companies are not “engaged in nonpecuniary social investment or a boycott of certain companies.”

These companies include those that engage in or do business with a company “that engages in, the exploration, production, utilization, transportation, or sale of fossil fuel-based energy, timber, mining, or production agriculture,” and those that engage in or do business with a company “that engages in, the manufacturing, distribution, sale, import, export, or lawful use of firearms, firearm parts, firearm accessories, or ammunition.”

The bill also restricts state public funds from contracting for investment or management of security services from any company on the state’s scrutinized list or “if the company would engage in nonpecuniary social investment or a boycott of certain companies on behalf of the public fund.”

Hawkeye State lawmakers would be well advised to understand the impact that ESG investing has not only on its pensioners but on the very industries that are central to Iowa’s economy. As Heritage Action for America notes, these institutions are targeting key Iowa industries like food production and agriculture, by “pushing companies to go green by promoting lower-carbon alternatives to meat and dairy products, targeting fertilizer use, and electrifying farm machinery.” Recent reports are showing with greater clarity the effect such principles and guided investments will have on key sectors such as agriculture. Iowa—producer of one-eleventh of the America’s food supply, and the nation’s largest producer of corn, eggs, and pork, to cite just some examples—would disproportionately bear the high costs of this agenda.

Critics of anti-ESG legislation have charged that bills such as Iowa’s SSB 1094 distort the free market and could possibly lower a state’s credit rating. However, the true distortion is being perpetrated by those seeking to use the financial agencies as a de facto governmental regulator. By allowing ESG to gain a foothold in Iowa, Hawkeye State legislators would be perpetuating this distorted marketplace, and nothing in the bill forces Iowa fiduciaries to use uneconomical investment options.

The collusion of corporations and institutions to boycott, divest from, or sanction any industry only hurts Iowa consumers and shareholders and could affect the long-term economic health of the state’s economy. By clarifying the fiduciary duties of Iowa’s pension fund managers by ensuring state funds don’t go to entities participating in and funding commercial boycotts, and by insisting that maximizing the return on investment for clients be their only guiding principle, Iowa legislators can help ensure the long-term fiscal health of both the Hawkeye State’s pension systems and economy as a whole.

Research & Commentary: Anti-ESG Bill in Nebraska Will Ensure Cornhusker State Pension Funds Invested Appropriately,"Tim Benson, Jack McPherrin","Legislation in the Nebraska Legislature would combat environmental, social and governance (ESG) scoring systems and ensure state pension funds are invested solely to achieve the maximum return on investment for pensioners, rather than advancing social or political causes that may likely lead to lower returns and / or underperformance.

ESG scores are essentially a risk assessment mechanism increasingly being used by investment firms and financial institutions that forces large and small companies to focus upon politically motivated, subjective goals which often run counter to their financial interests and the interests of their customers. Companies are graded on these mandated commitments to promote, for example, climate or social justice objectives. Those that score poorly are punished by divestment and reduced access to credit and capital.

To combat this, LB743 states that a fiduciary “shall take into account only financial factors when discharging its duties with respect to investments of public funds.”

Further, the bill notes a fiduciary “may be reasonably determined to have taken an action or considered a factor with a purpose to further social, political, or ideological interests based on evidence indicating the purpose, including a fiduciary commitment to further, through portfolio company engagement, board or shareholder votes, or otherwise as a fiduciary…beyond the federal or state law requirements” in regards to “eliminating, offsetting, or disclosing greenhouse gas emissions.”

Under the bill, fiduciaries may also be determined to have taken an action adverse to their clients’ financial interests—due to ideological objectives—by “divesting from, limiting investment in, or limiting the activities or investments of a company” that, for example: does not commit to specific environmental standards or disclosures or manufactures, distributes or sells firearms.

As Heritage Action for America notes, “using asset managers that engage and vote shares based on ESG can reduce the value of pension fund assets over the long-term. For example, [the world’s largest investment firm] Blackrock has voted against directors for failing to set emissions reduction targets or for increasing exposure to fossil fuel assets such as coal. In 2020, Blackrock voted against the directors of a utility for increasing its exposure to coal related assets, even though such exposure would no doubt have been financially beneficial. Such actions prevent companies from making money during periods when being anti-ESG is profitable. Over time, this will reduce the value of pension fund assets.”



LB743 further provides that proxy voting must be directed or exercised by a representative of the fiduciary in accord with the provisions of this law. Currently, only two firms—Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis—control 97 percent of the proxy advisory market and have stridently committed to ESG principles.



ISS and Glass Lewis are currently under scrutiny by several state attorneys general for collusion and antitrust violations.

Moreover, Cornhusker state lawmakers would be well advised to understand the impact that ESG investing has not only on its pensioners but on the very industries that are central to Nebraska’s economy. Recent reports are showing with greater clarity the effect such principles and guided investments will have on key sectors such as agriculture.

Critics of anti-ESG legislation have charged that bills such as Nebraska’s LB743 distort the free market and could possibly lower a state’s credit rating. However, the true distortion is being perpetrated by those seeking to use the financial agencies as a de facto governmental regulator. By allowing ESG to gain a foothold in Nebraska, Cornhusker State legislators would be perpetuating this distorted marketplace, and nothing in the bill forces Nebraska fiduciaries to use uneconomical investment options.

By clarifying the fiduciary duties of Nebraska’s pension fund managers, and by insisting that maximizing the return on investment for clients be their only guiding principle, Nebraska legislators can help ensure the long-term fiscal health of the state’s pension systems and make sure that promises proffered to state pensioners will be kept.

ESG: Central Bank Digital Currencies,Jack McPherrin,"Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores are an insidious mechanism by which a cabal of ideologically aligned influential interests working through unelected supranational organizations are attempting to “reset” the global financial system to their advantage. At its core, this emerging design circumvents national sovereignty, free markets, and individual rights by altering traditional financial methods of assessing risk and allocating capital and credit. This attempted shift from “shareholder capitalism” to a “stakeholder collectivism” model hinges upon assigning companies, and soon individuals, arbitrarily determined ESG social credit scores. These scores mandate subjective and politically motivated commitments to “climate” and “social justice” objectives, which draw heavily from the United Nations-sponsored Sustainable Development Goals.1

Essentially, ESG operates by punishing poorly scored companies with reduced or altogether eliminated access to capital and credit, while highly scored companies receive substantial capital in-flows, in addition to tax breaks, grants, access to “special financial vehicles,” preferential contracting, and potentially other yet-to-be-defined advantages.2 Ultimately, these measures are designed to centralize power and wealth in the hands of unelected technocrats, central bankers, regulators, and globalist institutions. The full institutionalization of ESG—internationally and domestically—would represent a major step towards consolidating a unitary global governance model, ultimately causing the dissolution of free markets, national sovereignty, due process under the law, and individual liberty.3

Wind Turbines and Wildlife Impacts,Jack McPherrin,"Impact on Birds and Bats

Substantial research has been conducted that links wind turbines to avian fatalities. The majority of birds that are impacted by wind turbines are birds of prey. Wind turbines create wind vortexes that draw in birds and cause fatal collisions with the turbine blades. Birds of prey and wind developers are both drawn to the same sites—hills, ridges, and other elevated areas—where stronger currents provide more stable power for wind turbines, while also providing a greater lift for soaring birds. In fact, as the Department of Energy explained in a 1997 budget request, “wind farms have been documented to act as both bait and executioner—rodents taking shelter at the base of turbines multiply with the protection from raptors [another word for birds of prey], while in turn their greater numbers attract more raptors to the farm.”

For a more concrete real world example, researchers in India found approximately four times fewer buzzards, hawks, kites, and other large birds in areas with wind farms. Moreover, the loss of the ecosystem’s primary predators has had a ripple effect on the food chain, with many small animal populations growing unchecked. In the United States, the expansion of wind turbines could result in the extinction of the golden eagle. Generally speaking, wind energy threatens large birds such as eagles, owls, hawks, kestrels, kites, and falcons disproportionately to their smaller cousins. This is especially concerning because these larger birds are of higher conservation value and because they do not reproduce at a high rate.

Bats, too, are heavily affected by wind turbines. Bats die from sudden drops in air pressure, as their lungs cannot accommodate for the change in pressure caused by the turbine-induced wind vortex. Though bats are typically able to detect man-made structures and avoid them by using echolocation, turbine blades are undetectable due to the pressure drops. As such, wind turbines kill bats in two ways: turbine blades directly collide with bats, and wind vortexes cause bats lungs to collapse.

The Institute for Energy Research contends that “wind turbines are the single greatest human threat to migratory bats, which live in different habitats during summer and winter months.” Scientists warned in 2017 that the hoary bat could become extinct if wind farm expansion continues. U.S. Geological Survey research biologist Paul Cryan emphasized in a 2011 article published in Environmental Law, “Wind energy facilities kill a significant number of bats far exceeding any documented natural or human-caused sources of mortality in the affected species…There are no other well-documented threats to populations of migratory tree bats that cause mortality of similar magnitude to that observed at wind turbines.”

Overall, multiple academic studies have found that wind energy generation in the United States alone was estimated to have killed between 600,000 to 888,000 bats, 214,000 to 368,000 small birds, and between 234,000 to 573,000 birds of all sizes in 2012. And, since wind energy production has more than doubled in the past decade, these numbers are likely twice as high today.

Impact on Insects

Until very recently, little research had been conducted on the impact of wind turbines upon the insect population, though this issue is starting to gain more attention. Insects are vital to the planet for many reasons, not the least of which is their importance to food production. At least 75 percent of global food crop types depend on insect pollinators, including 70 of the 100 most important human food crops.

One global assessment suggests that land-based insect abundance has declined by 9 percent per decade since the 1960s, for an overall decline of 43 percent. Another study estimates that approximately 10 percent of all insect species are critically endangered. Bees are particularly at risk; more than 100 wild bee species are at various levels of endangerment, which is especially frightening when considering honeybees alone carry out 80 percent of overall U.S. crop pollination. Moreover, insects are a vital source of food for many animal populations; with less insects available to eat, there would almost certainly be cascading effects upon animal populations and the ecosystem’s food chain.

Ironically, the same environmental groups bemoaning the rapidly declining insect population are typically the same groups championing the use of green energy, such as wind turbines. And, recent studies have proven that wind turbines have a direct causal effect upon insect death. One study conducted by the German Aerospace Center estimated that 1,200 tons of insect biomass are lost annually to collisions with Germany’s 30,000 onshore wind turbines. As another academic article explains, “Assuming an average wet mass of 1 mg for an insect… this equates to about 1.2 trillion insects killed per year for all onshore wind turbines in Germany, or 40 million insects killed annually be a single wind turbine in Germany.”

There are approximately 70,000 wind turbines in the United States as of 2022. As of 2016, there were 341,000 on the planet, according to the Global Wind Energy Council. Assuming that each wind turbine on the planet averages 40 million insect deaths annually, as in Germany, this would equate to approximately 2,800,000,000,000 (2.8 quadrillion) annual insect deaths attributable to wind turbines in the United States alone. As for the planet, this would equate to 13,640,000,000,000 (13.64 quadrillion) insect deaths attributable to wind turbines per year. And, the latter number is based upon 2016’s global wind turbine count, which has almost certainly significantly increased in the past six years.

The vast amount of avian and insect deaths at the hands of wind turbines is disastrous in and of itself, from a conservation and ecological standpoint. Equally concerning, however, is the serious downstream effect upon crop production and the global food supply, especially at a time when farmers and agricultural producers are suffering from stringent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) score mandates. The most direct link between wind turbines and declining food production is the aforementioned reduction in pollinator insects, which will lead to less crop yields. A secondary link is that the declining insect populations will reduce the food available for other animals, many of which are relied upon for food as well. For example, birds that run out of insects to eat have begun to turn on each other, and eat one another to survive. Many land-based animals will suffer from population decline as well, even if they do not rely on insects for food. Many animals rely upon flora that needs to be pollinated by insects to grow; without pollinators, these animals will suffer.

Overall, ecosystems are incredibly complex, but insects have always provided the basis of the food chain. Without them, everything collapses. While it is difficult to quantify the precise degree to which wind turbines will affect the global food supply in the future, one thing is certain: wind turbines undoubtedly cause massive avian and insect deaths on a yearly basis.

Research & Commentary: Data Shows Methane Emissions in Colorado Declined Significantly Despite Large Increase in Oil Production,Tim Benson,"New satellite data analyzed by the Colorado Oil and Gas Association (COGA), methane emissions in Colorado’s Front Range, the easternmost section of the Rocky Mountains, have been steadily falling.

According to COGA, satellite data from an new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Atmospheric Chemistry & Physics shows methane emissions have decreased 72 percent from a study published in 2015. This methane emissions decrease has occurred over the same period that oil production in Colorado has increased by about one third, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“Colorado’s oil and natural gas workers continue to innovate and strive to position Colorado as a global leader in producing the cleanest energy molecules that we all need and use every day,” said COGA President and CEO Dan Haley in a press release. “Despite what the ‘leave-it-in-the-ground’ environmental lobbyists might say, Colorado’s oil and natural gas operators continue to decrease our climate footprint, while at the same time increasing production.”

Oil and gas production, primarily driven by hydraulic fracturing or “fracking,” are a major driver of Colorado’s economy. A 2021 report commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute and undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers found the oil and natural gas industries directly or indirectly supported over 235,000 jobs in Colorado in 2019, or 8.6 percent of the total share of state employment. Further, the oil and gas industries produced $25.2 billion in labor income, which was 13.4 percent of the state total share, and had a statewide economic impact of $30.7 billion, for 11.7 percent of the state total share.

The importance of the oil and gas industries to the Colorado economy is crystal clear, yet that doesn’t stop environmental activists and state policymakers from looking for ways to curtail the activities of the industries in the Centennial State, or to go even further and eliminate their presence altogether. This would be disastrous for Coloradoans.

A report released in November 2019 by the Global Energy Institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce details how a ban on hydraulic fracturing (colloquially known as “fracking”) would have devastating consequences for the Colorado economy. According to the study, if a fracking ban took place, Colorado would experience the cumulative loss of 468,000 jobs thanks to higher residential and business energy costs and upstream production losses, as well as $187 billion in lost gross domestic product (GDP), and a $14.9 billion loss in state and local tax revenues by 2025. Over that same period, Colorado households would experience a $120 billion loss of income and Coloradans would suffer a per capita cost-of-living increase of $6,490.

A 2020 report from API, with modeling data provided by the consulting firm OnLocation, has unemployment numbers in Colorado due to a fracking ban that mirror GEI’s study, with 353,000 lost jobs in 2022 alone.

The development of shale reserves in Colorado has turned the state into the seventh-largest producer of natural gas in the United States, as well as the fourth-largest producer of crude oil. This massive increase in domestic shale development, led by fracking, has caused natural gas prices to plummet in Colorado, saving state residents and businesses more than $12.4 billion from 2006 to 2016, according to a 2018 study from the Consumer Energy Alliance.

For what it’s worth, a 2020 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Energy Research & Social Science found Colorado voters living in close proximity to an oil or natural gas drilling site were more likely to oppose 2018’s failed Proposition 112 ballot initiative that would have effectively banned fracking across the state than those who live far away from a drilling site.

The oil and natural gas deposits found in Colorado are abundant, inexpensive, and environmentally safe, and can ensure the United States is the world’s largest energy producer well beyond the 21st century. Therefore, Colorado policymakers should refrain from placing unnecessary burdens on the natural gas and oil industries, which are safe and positively impact the state economy.

This emerging design would circumvent national and individual sovereignty by altering traditional financial methods of assessing risk and debt / capital allocation. This attempted shift from “shareholder capitalism” to a “stakeholder collectivism” model hinges upon assigning companies, and soon individuals, arbitrarily determined ESG scores. These scores would mandate subjective, difficult-to-define, and equally difficult-to-evaluate metrics assessing one’s commitment to “climate” and “social justice” issues. Essentially, poorly scored companies suffer reduced or altogether eliminated access to capital and credit, while highly scored companies receive “preferred status” capital in-flows via traditional capital and debt markets, in addition to tax credits, grants, access to “special financial vehicles,” preferential contracting, and potentially other yet-to-be-defined advantages through future legislation, executive action, or international treaty.

ESG’s metrics have ostensibly been designed to combat systemic global problems such as climate change, racial inequality, and world hunger—in alignment with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. In reality, these measures will simply centralize power and control in the hands of unelected technocrats and private global institutions influenced solely by the wealthy elite who control monetary policy, capital, and credit through global central banks, where “baskets of currencies” make up the current global system.

Energy at a Glance: Wind and the Environment,Linnea Lueken,"Wind turbines do not produce any direct carbon dioxide emissions during operation, however, they do produce a variety of negative environmental impacts that merit attention.

When considering the environmental effects of wind energy, one must consider the space taken up by, or footprint of, wind power plants. Although individual towers have a relatively small footprint, studies suggest the total land use and environmental impact of wind farms throughout the county is significant.

Energy at a Glance: Wind Costs and Generation,Linnea Lueken,"Wind energy is electric power generated by wind-driven turbines. The wind turns the turbine blades, which turn a drive shaft that connects to a gearbox that converts the rotor power, turning an electric generator, which produces electricity that is sent to the grid. In direct-drive turbines, the gearbox is left out and the rotors directly stimulate the generator. In both cases, electricity is generated when the blades spin.

Wind turbines can be placed on land, offshore in the form similar to onshore towers, or on floating structures for deeper water applications.

Wind energy currently accounts for approximately 9 percent of net electricity generation in the United States. According to 2020 data, wind accounts for 5.3 percent of worldwide electricity generation, and 2.2 percent of total global energy, which includes transportation and heating. The top three countries with the largest amount of wind energy are China with 328.97 gigawatts (GW) installed wind energy capacity, the United States with 132.74 GW, and Germany with 63.76 GW.

"Research & Commentary: New Report Details How to Strengthen America, Weaken Putin, and Make the World Safer Via Increased American Energy Production",Tim Benson,"American Experiment North Dakota has released a report detailing how American leadership on energy concerns, and a ramping up of domestic energy sources, can reduce Russia’s strategic leverage over European countries and help make the world a safer place.

In Energy Leadership: How American Energy Production Can Make the World Safer, Isaac Orr and John Phelan of the Center of the American Experiment note that Russia currently is one of the largest producers of energy on the planet, as the third-largest producer of petroleum and the second-largest producer of dry natural gas. Oil and gas exports, disproportionally important to the Russian economy, made up about 45 percent of all Russian exports in 2021. Essentially, the country is basically a giant oil emirate.

Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) relies heavily on Russia for the energy needed to power its member states. Russia supplies the EU with over a quarter of its crude oil imports and roughly one-third of their natural gas imports. Obviously, this provides Russian President Vladimir Putin with a large amount of leverage in his geopolitical strategy. For example, the authors point out, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has suggested that Germany, which receives over half of its natural gas and 30 percent of its crude oil from Russia, would most likely not support energy sanctions on the country after its invasion of Ukraine because Russian energy is of “essential importance” to daily life in the German nation.

However, the authors note that Russia’s dependence on its energy exports to fund its economy is a very dangerous source of potential weakness for the country, over the long term. Around a third of Russian imports are invoiced in U.S. dollars and the Euro. Russian access to these two currencies used to purchase a significant number of import goods is made from the sale of its energy sources. The less energy the Russians can sell, the worse it is for their economy, and the less likely it makes Russia able to finance acts of aggression against its neighbors in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia.

The easiest way to reduce Russian geopolitical leverage is by ramping up the production of American energy sources, especially fossil fuels and nuclear power. Ramping up “renewable” energy sources alone will not allow the United States to achieve this objective. “Wind and solar are utterly incapable of delivering on this desired outcome, which means building more wind turbines and solar panels would simply double down on the failed policies that allowed Russia to leverage its energy sector for geopolitical gain in the first place,” the authors state. “Wind and solar are incapable of materially increasing energy security because they are unreliable, weather-dependent technologies that are primarily manufactured abroad using metals and minerals mined and refined in foreign countries.”

“Rather than impeding American [fossil fuel] energy production, we should fully embrace it,” the authors continue. “This would entail rolling back several initiatives enacted by the Biden administration that discourage domestic oil production and favor production by the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and Russia. The U.S. should also construct new coal export terminals, allowing more American coal to reach global markets and allow European nations to diversify their fuel supply.”

Beyond this, the authors continue “the United States must make a concerted effort to build new nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plants are the only scalable source of electricity generation that can replace coal and natural gas, leaving more of these essential fuels available for export. A robust domestic nuclear power industry will also allow the U.S. to export reactor designs to other countries to compete with Russian and Chinese plant designs, which will enhance American influence abroad without the need for military deployment…. Embracing American energy production and export will enhance economic opportunities in the United States, provide our allies with the energy they need, and undermine a key revenue stream for…the Kremlin.”

“The role of Saudi Arabia and its oil industry in the collapse of the Soviet Union and the peaceful ending of the Cold War is a seldom commented on but important factor,” the authors conclude. “Vladimir Putin’s Russia is no less dependent on the production and export of oil and natural gas today as was the Soviet Union inherited by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985. This weakness masquerading as a strength is there to be exploited now, as it was then. And, as then, it offers an important tool in resolving international conflicts without resort to military means. Maximizing the energy resources of the United States to the fullest will yield significant economic benefits, but its greatest legacy could be a more peaceful future.”

Research & Commentary: Congressional Bill Would Block Federal Infrastructure Funds from Heading to States that Have Banned Hydraulic Fracturing,Tim Benson,"Legislation introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives would block any state that bans the hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) process for accessing reserves of oil or natural gas from receive funds through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program from the U.S. Department of Energy.

The EECBG program, funded by a $550 million appropriation from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed last November, “provides local government, states, territories, and Indian tribes resources to implement strategies to reduce fossil fuel emissions,” reduce “the total energy use of the eligible entities,” and improve “energy efficiency in the transportation, building, and other appropriate sectors.”

The bill, titled the “American Energy is Global Security Act”, was introduced by New York Representative Claudia Tenney (R-22) as a way of getting the Empire State, and others that have followed its path, to correct its self-defeating energy policies.

“Much of Central New York, Western New York, and the Southern Tier lie above the Marcellus Shale and the deeper Utica Shale formations,” a press release from the congresswoman’s office states. “These resources have allowed neighboring Pennsylvania to become the 2nd largest natural gas producer in the United States, accounting for 20.5% of all domestic natural gas production. This energy development now supports 480 thousand Pennsylvania jobs and collects over $500 million for statewide environmental protection funding. Similarly, these formations could power New York for decades and help restore economic prosperity to the region.”

“Despite any firm environmental evidence,” the release continues, “the administration of disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo implemented a blanket statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing. The ban was then officially established in 2015 by the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and codified in 2020 by the New York State legislature. This baseless anti-energy policy has stopped our state from accessing a local lower-carbon energy source with the potential to meet the state’s energy needs for decades and provide necessary economic development to Upstate New York communities. It is time for the repeal of this failed ban and a return to a fact-driven energy policy.”

A 2021 report commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) found the oil and natural gas industries directly or indirectly supported over 11 million jobs across the country in 2019, produced $892 billion in labor income, and had a nationwide economic impact of nearly $1.7 trillion.

Hydraulic fracturing activity also delivers $1,300 to $1,900 in annual benefits to local households, including “a 7 percent increase in average income, driven by rises in wages and royalty payments, a 10 percent increase in employment, and a 6 percent increase in housing prices,” according to a December 2016 study conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago, Princeton University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Fracking enables the cost-effective extraction of once-inaccessible oil and natural gas deposits. These energy sources are abundant, inexpensive, environmentally safe, and can ensure the United States remains a leading energy producer well beyond the twenty-first century. Therefore, policymakers at all levels of government should refrain from placing unnecessary burdens on the natural gas and oil industries, which are safe and positively impact the United States.

Research & Commentary: New Heartland Study Shows 96 Percent of NOAA Surface Temperature Station Data Is Corrupted,"Tim Benson, Anthony Watts","A new study from The Heartland Institute finds roughly 96 percent of the temperature stations in the United States used to measure climate change fail to meet the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) standards for acceptable and uncorrupted placement.

The U.S. surface temperature record is determined from data gathered by the Cooperative Observer Network (COOP), administered by NOAA’s National Weather Service (NWS) division. Data are then compiled and presented to the public for climate change tracking by the National Centers for Environment Information (NCEI), formerly known as the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).

The report was compiled via satellite and in-person survey visits to NOAA weather stations measuring the “official” land temperature data in the United States. These visits show these stations are corrupted by localized effects of urbanization – producing heat-bias because of their close proximity to asphalt, machinery, and other heat-producing, heat-trapping, or heat-accentuating objects. Placing temperature stations in such locations violates NOAA’s own published standards, and strongly undermines the legitimacy and the magnitude of the official consensus on long-term climate warming trends in the United States.

NOAA’s “Requirements and Standards for Climate Observations” instructs that temperature data instruments must be “over level terrain (earth or sod) typical of the area around the station and at least 100 feet from any extensive concrete or paved surface,” and that “all attempts will be made to avoid areas where rough terrain or air drainage are proven to result in non-representative temperature data.” However, as detailed in the report, these instructions are regularly violated.

This new report is a follow up to a March 2009 study, “ Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable?,” which highlighted a subset of over 1,000 surveyed stations and found 89 percent of stations had heat-bias issues. In April and May 2022, The Heartland Institute’s team of researchers visited many of the same temperature stations as in 2009, in addition to new sites.

The new survey sampled 128 NOAA stations, ultimately finding the problem of heat-bias has only worsened. Of those stations visited in April and May of 2022, 80 were U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) stations, a subset of the COOP network—most of which were visited in the original report. The overall sample is broadly representative of the entire network, as it samples stations in a variety of U.S. states. Regional samples comprising many nearby stations were done in the western and southeastern United States, focusing on Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and South Carolina.

Of the 128 stations surveyed, only two were found to be a Class 1 (best-sited) stations: Dubois, the Idaho Agricultural Experiment Farm, and the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Farm. Just three stations were found to be Class 2 (acceptably sited), while the remaining 123 stations were found to be Class 3, 4, and 5, and therefore considered unacceptably sited.

“With a 96 percent warm-bias in U.S. temperature measurements, it is impossible to use any statistical methods to derive an accurate climate trend for the U.S.” said Heartland Institute Senior Fellow Anthony Watts, the director of the study. “Data from the stations that have not been corrupted by faulty placement show a rate of warming in the United States reduced by almost half compared to all stations.”

The findings of both the 2009 and the 2022 Surface Stations studies clearly demonstrate the COOP network’s temperature records—at both USCHN and GHCN stations—have been substantially corrupted. Claims by NOAA, NCDC, and NCEI that this data contamination can be statistically adjusted are disingenuous, especially considering the widescale homogenization of good and bad data. Good data exists in the unperturbed stations, but the amount of bad data from poorly sited stations overwhelms the accurate data from well-sited stations.

The study recommends NOAA/NWS should fully implement recommendations made by the U.S. Office of the Inspector General and Government Accountability Office on the state of the USCHN and apply those recommendations s to the entire COOP network, as well as immediately cease temperature data collection operations at waste-water treatment plants. These facilities have grown significantly in size and treatment volume over the past century as the U.S. population has grown, adding large heat sink capacity as well as waste heat of sewage digestion to the long-term temperature record.

Further, beyond modernizing the COOP network, a central authority, rather than the ad hoc collection of competing interests, should be created to evaluate stations and determine if they adhere to standards and produce suitable data. The authority should have the power to upgrade or close stations that cannot be brought into compliance.

Energy at a Glance: Biomass,Linnea Lueken,"Quick Bullets:

In 2021, biomass provided 5 percent of total primary energy use in the United States, with 2.1 percent of annual total energy consumption coming from wood-based biomass fuel.

Quality wood pellets with low moisture content have only about half as much energy content as an equivalent amount of coal (by mass).

Biomass power plants emit 50 to 85 percent more carbon dioxide than modern coal plants, and more than three times as much carbon dioxide as natural gas-fueled power plants.

Bioenergy currently constitutes 10 percent of the world’s total energy supply.

It can take 44 to 104 years to offset carbon dioxide emissions from burning biomass.

Energy at a Glance: The Importance of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG),Linnea Lueken,"President Joe Biden has called for the United States to increase exports of liquified natural gas (LNG) to Europe in order to help U.S. allies wean themselves from Russian natural gas. Unfortunately, the Biden administration’s climate policies have directly subverted this goal, as well as the U.S. energy dominance carefully crafted under the Trump administration.

A previous report by The Heartland Institute, “The History and Importance of U.S. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG),” served as a primer on LNG and discusses the transition from the United States being a net importer to a net exporter of LNG. This paper discusses the current status of LNG exports and how government policies impact the U.S. LNG industry.

Quick Bullets

• LNG export terminals are currently operating at 89 percent of peak capacity.

• In February 2022, America was exporting around $114 million of LNG every day.

• U.S. LNG export expansion would increase jobs, reduce the trade deficit, and decrease our allies’ dependence on natural gas from Russia, which would enhance geopolitical stability.

• The Biden administration stymied U.S. shipments of LNG to many nations from January 2021 through March 2022. • To the extent some modest increase in LNG exports is finally likely, the increase is largely the culmination of Trump administration efforts, which have been reduced by Biden administration policies, and is far less than American energy producers capable and willing to provide.

Research & Commentary: New Report Details the Safety of the Country’s Pipeline Infrastructure,Tim Benson,"The American Petroleum Institute (API) and the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (AOPL) have released the latest in their annual reports on pipeline safety showing how liquids pipelines have become significantly safer over the last five years.

The analysis, 2021 Pipeline Safety Excellence Performance Report, details how total liquids pipeline safety incidents have dropped by 17 percent over the last five years, including a 31 percent drop in incidents impacting the environment or people, and a 32 percent drop in incidents caused by corrosion, cracking or weld failures. Safety incidents in public spaces outside of operator facilities also decreased 37 percent since 2017, and incidents in “high consequence areas” such as “areas of population concentration, commercially navigable waterways, or sensitive environmental locations” also dropped by 16 percent.

Large safety incidents, those of 500 spilled barrels or larger, have declined by 16 percent since 2017 and are now only 6 percent of total incidents. The report also notes that 66 percent of safety incidents were less than 5 barrels, and 84 percent of incidents were less than 50 barrels. All this even though “total liquids pipeline mileage [being] up 8 percent over the last 5 years with crude oil pipeline mileage rising 9,597 miles or 13 percent and natural gas liquid mileage increasing by 6,065 miles or 9 percent between 2016 and 2020.”

“Liquids pipelines perform the vital role of delivering U.S. produced energy to American consumers,” API-AOPL Pipeline Safety Excellence Steering Committee Chair and President of Phillips 66 Pipeline Todd Denton said in the report’s introduction. “The additional U.S. crude oil production we need to increase American energy security and supplies will flow by pipeline. This year’s performance report on industry-wide pipeline safety metrics shows pipelines are safe and getting safer.”

The report also notes that the oil and natural gas industries have sent $1.1 trillion to the federal, state, and local treasuries through royalty payments, fees, and taxes through 2019 while these industries support roughly 11.3 million jobs nationwide.

Because supplies of natural gas are limited, and because some politicians try to undermine fossil fuel production at every step, prices are necessarily driven up. Higher electricity costs disproportionally hurt low-income families, who naturally spend a larger percentage of their money keeping the lights on. Adding pipeline infrastructure would lower electricity prices, thereby raising living standards, stimulating long-term economic growth and creating a substantial increase in net jobs.

Living standards increase because lower-cost electricity frees up money for consumers to purchase additional goods and services, which improve people’s lives. Economic growth and net job numbers would also increase, because the newly available money spent on goods and services would spur job growth throughout the economy.

Instead of trying to shut them down, legislators should work to insure infrastructure such as pipelines continues to grow meet ever-increasing demand for fossil fuels. Making sure the necessary pipeline mileage get built to keep up with this demand, or at the very least stays stationary, is a must to help make sure families across the United States can take advantage of the economic benefits these pipelines provide.

This study from the Global Energy Institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says a ban on fracking in the United States would be catastrophic for our economy. Their analysis shows that if such a ban were imposed in 2021, by 2025 it would eliminate 19 million jobs and reduce U.S. Gross Domestic Product by $7.1 trillion. Tax revenue at the local, state, and federal levels would decline by nearly a combined $1.9 trillion. Natural gas prices would leap by 324 percent, causing household energy bills to more than quadruple. By 2025, motorists would pay twice as much at the pump for gasoline as oil prices spike to $130 per barrel, while less domestic energy production would also mean less energy security.

If a ban is enacted, the U.S. would flip from being a net exporter of oil and petroleum products to importing more than 40 percent of supplies by 2030.

They are dramatically increasing the quantity of food humans produce and improving the reliability of the food supply, directly benefiting human health. Further, fossil fuel emissions are possibly contributing to a “Greening of the Earth,” benefiting all the plants and wildlife on the planet.

Energy at a Glance: U.S. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG),Linnea Lueken,"Introduction to LNG

Liquified natural gas, commonly called LNG, is primarily methane (CH4) cooled to a liquified form for transportation and storage. LNG makes it possible for natural gas to be imported and exported around the world in a safe and affordable manner. In its liquefied form, natural gas is easier to transport across vast distances because it does not require pipelines. LNG can be delivered via tanker ships, trucks, and railcars due to the fact that it takes up less space than gaseous state methane.

Fracking Changes Everything: From Imports to Exports

In the early 2000s, the United States was predicted to have looming natural gas shortages. Federal policies made public lands difficult to develop for natural gas production. Moreover, production from existing wells on state and private lands was declining. Prices were high and the United States was importing LNG to satisfy growing demand.

In 2006, there were five LNG terminals in the United States, all designed to import LNG, with a capacity of around 4 billion cubic feet per day. At that time, 41 LNG projects were under consideration to increase U.S. import capacity. However, beginning in 2008, the fracking and shale gas revolution fueled a huge increase in natural gas production in the United States, which meant the United States no longer needed to import large amounts of LNG.

Horizontal drilling combined with fracking-improved production allowed U.S. producers to access large, untapped deposits of shale gas reserves and other unconventional formations that had previously been too difficult to access.

Research & Commentary: New Study Details Damage Done to Vulnerable Avian Populations By Wind and Solar Energy,Tim Benson,"A study published in March in Royal Society Open Science, a peer-reviewed journal claims that wind turbine and solar farms in California are making life significantly worse for nearly half of the “vulnerable” bird species that fly over them.

According to the study, 11 of 23 bird species, including barn owls, golden eagles, roadrunners, and yellow-billed cuckoos, “were either highly or moderately vulnerable [to wind and solar farms], experiencing a greater than or equal to 20% decline in the population growth rates with the addition of up to either 1,000 or 5,000 fatalities, respectively.”

“Effects of renewables extended far beyond the location of energy production to impact bird populations in distant regions across continental migration networks,” the study continues. “Populations of species associated with grasslands where turbines were located were most vulnerable to wind. Populations of nocturnal migrant species were most vulnerable to solar, despite not typically being associated with deserts where the solar facilities we evaluated were located. Our findings indicate that addressing declines of North American bird populations requires consideration of the effects of renewables and other anthropogenic threats on both nearby and distant populations of vulnerable species.”

Multiple studies published in 2013 and 2014 found that somewhere between 140,000 and 679,000 birds are killed by wind turbines annually. However, the American Bird Conservatory estimates at a minimum 681,000 birds are killed annually by turbines, thanks to an 86 percent increase in wind energy capacity in the United States from 2012 to 2021. They go on to note that “these estimates likely underestimate the true extent of the problem due to the fact that many bird fatalities escape human detection.” (Emphasis in the original.)

Wind is not the only culprit in bird fatalities. The Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in the Mojave Desert, for example, is responsible for incinerating around 6,000 birds annually.

Avian fatalities are not the only environmental concern when it comes to “renewable” energy sources. To dramatically ramp up wind and solar electricity generation to the point where the entire electrical grid in the United States is powered by wind and solar would “necessitate an unprecedented worldwide expansion in mining,” according to a Heartland Institute Policy Brief. “And those mining operations would rely primarily on fossil-fuel-powered heavy equipment, since battery-powered equipment for enormous industrial operations does not exist.”

These mining operations would also involve “removing and crushing hundreds of billions of tons of rock and ore, causing major habitat losses and widespread pollution,” according to the brief. “It would also create serious human health impacts, especially in countries that do not have modern equipment and health and safety protections.”

Among these mining operation would be those for rare earth elements (REE) such as dysprosium, indium, neodymium, and tellurium, which are necessary to produce wind turbines or photovoltaic solar panels. However, mining a single ton of these REEs, according to the brief, produces up to 420,000 cubic feet of toxic gases, 2,600 cubic feet of acidic wastewater, and a ton of radioactive waste. More than 70 percent of the world’s REEs are either mined in China, a totalitarian communist dictatorship with a dismal environmental and human rights record, or by companies under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.

Other materials needed to be mined to produce solar panels and wind turbines, as well as to produce the anticipated battery backups systems for these “renewable” sources, include lithium, cobalt, and copper. To store a week’s worth of electricity for the entire country when wind and solar aren’t generating it, the Heartland brief estimates would require “two billion half-ton battery packs similar to those used in Tesla automobiles.” Each of these batteries would require at least 26 pounds of lithium.

The cobalt needed for these batteries is mostly mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than 40,000 children currently labor in mining operations for pittance wages in unsafe and unhealthy conditions. Copper mining would also have to be dramatically expanded to meet the demand for 100 percent renewable generation, even though it takes roughly 125,000 pounds of mined, crushed, and refined ore to produce 1,000 pounds of finished copper.

Although the United States has proven reserves of these commodities, environmental policy at both the state and federal level have closed off most of these deposits from mining. Therefore, the brief argues, pushing for 100 percent renewable generation would increase our dependence for these minerals on China and “other countries that regularly disregard workplace safety, child labor concerns, land reclamation, and pollution controls.”

There are massive environmental tradeoffs in the large-scale use of wind and solar power, among them a substantial decrease in the amount of birds in our skies. Legislators should take this and other environmental concerns into account when debating on whether to promote wind and solar sources of energy.

The Social Benefits of Fossil Fuels

https://heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/the-social-benefits-of-fossil-fuels

This Heartland Policy Brief by Joseph Bast and Peter Ferrara documents the many benefits from the historic and still ongoing use of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are lifting billions of people out of poverty, reducing all the negative effects of poverty on human health, and vastly improving human well-being and safety by powering labor-saving and life-protecting technologies, such as air conditioning, modern medicine, and cars and trucks. They are dramatically increasing the quantity of food humans produce and improving the reliability of the food supply, directly benefiting human health. Further, fossil fuel emissions are possibly contributing to a “Greening of the Earth,” benefiting all the plants and wildlife on the planet.

Research & Commentary: Massachusetts Program Pushing Zero-Emission Vehicle Sales is Environmentally Self-Defeating,Tim Benson,"Legislation in the Massachusetts Senate would establish a $250 million program for clean energy expansion, electric vehicle incentives, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Further, all vehicles sold in the commonwealth would be required to be “zero-emission vehicles” (ZEVs) by 2035. The bill is aimed to help Massachusetts reach statewide “net-zero” carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

The push for broad-based adoption of zero-emission vehicles and low-emission vehicles (LEVs) through programs like the one featured in this piece of legislation will likely only increase pollution and environmental costs, according to a May 2018 study from the Manhattan Institute. “Based on data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA),” the study notes, “increased reliance on ZEVs will increase overall emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates, compared with the same number of new internal combustion vehicles, even after accounting for emissions from petroleum refineries.”

Furthermore, there is effectively no economic value to the potential carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission reductions of ZEVs. “Although new ZEVs will reduce CO 2 emissions compared with new internal combustion vehicles, the overall reduction will be less than 1% of total forecast energy-related U.S. CO 2 emissions through 2050,” the study continues. “That reduction will have no measurable impact on world climate and thus no economic value.”

“Even if, by 2050, all internal combustion vehicles were replaced by ZEVs,” the study concludes, “the resulting reduction in CO 2 emissions would be less than 500 million tons per year. This is less than half the estimated annual impact of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s now-moribund Clean Power Plan, which itself would have had no impact on world climate.”

The exorbitant cost of federal and state subsidies for ZEVs and their charging infrastructure is also highlighted in the study. In California alone, costs are estimated to exceed $100 billion, which will primarily be funded by low-income and middle-class families. Ironically, these families are unlikely to own ZEVs due to their high costs. In the end, mostly wealthy Golden State residents are benefitting from the taxpayer subsidies, and this will remain true for wealthy Bay Staters.

A 2013 study from the University of California at Davis found 83 percent of California ZEV owners had household incomes exceeding $100,000, with 46 percent earning incomes above $150,000. The average Tesla owner was found to have a household income of $293,000 that same year. A more recent study by the Pacific Research Institute found 79 percent of electric vehicle plug-in tax credits were claimed by households with adjusted gross incomes greater than $100,000.

The questionable, meager environmental gains to be achieved by adopting tax breaks and subsidies encouraging the broad-based adoption of ZEVs and LEVs are far outweighed by the extraordinary cost to vehicle owners and taxpayers. Such government subsidies and incentives make for poor public policy because they encourage rent-seeking, subvert the market’s natural mechanism for matching supply with demand at the correct price, and clash with other government incentives, all of which creates adverse fiscal consequences.

This Manhattan Institute study concludes the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in the United States will likely increase air pollution compared with new internal combustion vehicles.

Research & Commentary: Report Finds Line 5 Pipeline Shutdown Would Cost Midwest Families Billions in Additional Fuel Costs,Tim Benson,"A new report from the Consumer Energy Alliance (CEA) argues shutdown of Enbridge’s Line 5 crude oil and natural gas liquids pipeline would possibly result in $23.7 billion in higher fuel costs for families and businesses in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania over the next five years.

Line 5 traverses from a western terminus in Superior, Wisconsin through Michigan to an eastern one in Sarnia, Ontario. There are currently efforts underway by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer to shut down the pipeline due to concerns about a leak in the pipeline in a four-mile stretch that passes under the Straits of Mackinac, even though the pipeline has been leak-free since it was put into operation in 1953.

The report, Enbridge Line 5 Shutdown: Impacts on Transportation Fuel Prices, estimates the closure of Line 5 would result in a regional fuel price spike of between 9.47 and 11.66 percent, and that this increase is “independent of any other market conditions, such as the surge in fuel prices observed over the past 12 months that are tied to international oil markets and logistical challenges caused by the [COVID-19] pandemic.”

Ohio residents and businesses would see $2.73 billion in higher fuel prices (gasoline and diesel) over the next five years, while Michiganders would see $2.22 billion in higher costs, Hoosiers would see $272 million, and Pennsylvanians $630 million.

“The jump in transportation fuel prices will not be borne evenly across all consumer groups,” the analysis notes. “But given current macro-economic trends, most of these higher costs will likely be passed on to households. Based on research into broader energy price inflation, these cost increases will further push up food prices, especially for beef, pork, and corn. We estimate combined grocery and restaurant prices will rise an additional 0.2% to 0.3% on top of any other inflationary pressures in the economy.” In the longer term, rising transportation fuel prices will have negative impacts on regional economic competitiveness, particularly in manufacturing and related logistics services. These energy cost increases will lower economic growth rates, especially in Michigan and Ohio, for years to come. Households are already enduring the highest rate of inflation in 40 years with real wages and earnings declining over the past year. Adding further injury by enacting policies that will directly result in higher energy costs and the loss of thousands of regional jobs makes little economic sense. The closure of Line 5 would be the wrong action at the wrong time.”

A previous analysis done by CEA in 2021 found a Line 5 shutdown would see Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania lose $20.8 billion in lost economic activity and a $8.3 billion reduction in Gross State Product, as well as $265.7 million in lost state tax revenue. Further, closing Line 5 would lead to over 33,700 lost jobs in those four states and $2.36 billion in forgone labor earnings.

“In the longer term,” the 2022 report concludes, “rising transportation fuel prices will have negative impacts on regional economic competitiveness, particularly in manufacturing and related logistics services. These energy cost increases will lower economic growth rates, especially in Michigan and Ohio, for years to come. Households are already enduring the highest rate of inflation in 40 years with real wages and earnings declining over the past year. Adding further injury by enacting policies that will directly result in higher energy costs and the loss of thousands of regional jobs makes little economic sense. The closure of Line 5 would be the wrong action at the wrong time.”

Instead of trying to shut them down, legislators in the Midwest should work to insure infrastructure such as pipelines continues to grow meet ever-increasing demand for fossil fuels. Making sure the necessary pipeline mileage get built to keep up with this demand, or at the very least stays stationary, is a must to help make sure families in the Midwest, and across the United States, can take advantage of the economic benefits these pipelines provide.

The following documents provide more information about pipelines and fossil fuels.

What If…Hydraulic Fracturing Were Banned? (2020 Edition)

https://www.globalenergyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2019-12/hf_ban_report_final.pdf

This study from the Global Energy Institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says a ban on fracking in the United States would be catastrophic for our economy. Their analysis shows that if such a ban were imposed in 2021, by 2025 it would eliminate 19 million jobs and reduce U.S. Gross Domestic Product by $7.1 trillion. Tax revenue at the local, state, and federal levels would decline by nearly a combined $1.9 trillion. Natural gas prices would leap by 324 percent, causing household energy bills to more than quadruple. By 2025, motorists would pay twice as much at the pump for gasoline as oil prices spike to $130 per barrel, while less domestic energy production would also mean less energy security.

The study from the American Petroleum Institute (conducted by economic modeling firm OnLocation) warns that banning federal leasing and fracking on public and private lands, which some presidential candidates have proposed, would cost up to 7.5 million American jobs in 2022 alone, lead to a cumulative GDP loss of $7.1 trillion by 2030, slash household incomes by $5,400 annually, increase household energy costs by more than $600 per year and reduce farm incomes by 43 percent due to higher energy costs. If a ban is enacted, the U.S. would flip from being a net exporter of oil and petroleum products to importing more than 40 percent of supplies by 2030.

"Biden’s Energy Policy Sends $74 Million Per Day to Russia, Enough to Buy 20 Tanks Every Day",James Taylor,"Key Points:

America sends Russia $74 Million per day for oil imports.

America imported 24 percent more oil from Russia in 2021 than in 2020.

36 percent of Russia’s government budget comes from oil export revenue.

The Biden administration’s anti-American energy policy is responsible for America sending $74 million per day to Russia for oil imports, an analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data show, which is enough money for Russia to buy 20 T-14 tanks every day.

During the Trump administration, the United States became a net exporter of oil. For logistical reasons, America still imported oil from Russia, but America could – if necessary – turn off the Russian spigot and replace Russian oil with U.S. oil. Under the Biden administration’s war on domestic energy production, that has changed. America no longer produces enough oil to cover our needs and would have a much more difficult time replacing Russian oil imports.

During 2021, America imported 245 million barrels of oil from Russia, versus 197 million barrels in 2020. That amounts to a 24 percent increase during Biden’s first full year in office.

On a per-day basis at today’s oil price of $111 per barrel, America is sending Russia $74 million per day for oil imports. Even if one assumes that America would not be cutting off Russian oil imports had the United States remained a net oil exporter, the increase in average daily Russian oil imports between President Trump’s last year in office and the average daily imports under the Biden administration amounts to an extra $18 million per day we are sending to Russia, or five additional tanks per day.

The revenue from oil exports funds approximately 36 percent of the Russian government’s budget. If Biden is serious about punishing Vladimir Putin for invading a sovereign nation or preventing similar military aggression in the region, he should begin by hitting Russia where it is most vulnerable: oil and natural gas exports. Ramping up American oil and natural gas production would reduce or eliminate U.S. purchases of Russian energy. It would also allow other nations to buy energy from America rather than Russia.

Biden could pressure Democrats to stand up to environmental extremists who have blocked the construction of pipelines that could deliver more American oil and natural gas to Russia-dependent American markets. He could also expedite the approvals of new liquefied natural gas terminals and the pipelines delivering fuel to other nations rather than erecting new hurdles to natural gas exports as he has recently done. Biden could also reverse his decision to withdraw U.S. support for the EastMed natural gas pipeline from Israel to Europe.

Resuming our role as a net energy exporter would allow nations to stop purchasing Russian oil and gas and purchase American oil and gas instead. Without the energy-export money Russia needs to sustain its war machine, Russia will find it much harder to wage war on its neighbors. Ukrainian lives need to trump Biden’s self-defeating green energy fantasies.","March 3, 2022",PUBLICATION,Heartland,https://heartland.org/publications/bidens-energy-policy-sends-74-million-per-day-to-russia-enough-to-buy-20-tanks-every-day/
Research & Commentary: Bill to Introduce a Carbon-Dioxide Tax on Fossil Fuels is a Bad Idea for Utah,Tim Benson,"Legislation introduced in the Utah Senate would establish a carbon-dioxide tax on all fossil fuels emitted or sold by distributors in the Beehive State, including on “motor fuel, special fuel, aviation fuel, natural gas, petroleum, coal, or any form of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel derived from these products, including still gas, propane, or petroleum residuals.”

The tax on motor fuel would start in 2024 and 8.89 cents per gallon, and annually rise by 3.5 percent until the tax would cap out at 88.9 cents per gallon. The tax on special fuels would begin in 2024 at 10.16 cents per gallon, rising to $1.02 per gallon, while the tax on aviation fuel would start at 9.57 cents per gallon and top out at 95.7 cents per gallon.

The tax on natural gas would start at 53.12 cents per 1,000 cubic feet and would rise annually by 3.5 percent to $53.12 per 1,000 cubic feet. Taxes on “large emitters” of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions would begin at $10 per metric ton of CO 2 emitted, rising to $100 per metric ton.

The bill would also create an interest-earning “Carbon Emissions Tax Refund Restricted Account” that the Legislature could use the funds from which to lower other state taxes.

A Fiscal Note prepared for the bill found that while the funds from the account could lower sales taxes paid by individuals and business in Utah by $103.6 million in fiscal year (FY) 2024, $259.9 million in FY2025, and $271.6 million in FY2026, the carbon-dioxide tax itself would raise $137.8 million in FY2024, $609.8 million in FY2025, and $652.8 million in FY2026. This means a $34.2 million tax increase for Utah residents and businesses in FY2024, a $349.9 million tax increase in FY2025, and a $381.2 million tax increase in FY2026.

Unlike many other carbon tax bills proposed in other states, there is also no provision to return any collected tax revenue to low-income families or businesses in the form of a direct rebate or dividend. These rebates and dividends are important because carbon-dioxide taxes are inherently regressive and disproportionally harm low-income families.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) also found a $28-per-ton carbon tax would result in energy costs being 250 percent higher for the poorest one-fifth of households than the richest one-fifth of households. CBO reports the reason for cost discrepancy is “a carbon tax would increase the prices of fossil fuels in direct proportion to their carbon content. Higher fuel prices, in turn, would raise production costs and ultimately drive up prices for goods and services throughout the economy … Low-income households spend a larger share of their income on goods and services whose prices would increase the most, such as electricity and transportation.”

One other substantial problem with the carbon-dioxide tax is that it would produce an insignificant environmental benefit, as a country-wide carbon tax that completely reduces U.S. emissions to zero by 2050 would only avert global temperature by just 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2100. A state-based carbon dioxide tax would have even less impact on global temperature. As Oren Cass, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, noted in National Affairs, “The effectiveness of a carbon tax as a matter of environmental policy [depends] not only on how it would directly alter the trajectory of [local] emissions but also on its ability to affect global emissions by driving globally applicable technological innovation or by influencing the behavior of foreign governments,” wrote Cass. “On each of these dimensions, the carbon tax fails.”

At 8.27 cents per kilowatt hour, Utah currently has the fourth-lowest retail electricity prices in the United States, well below the national average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Also, a 2021 WalletHub study found at $311 per month, Utahans face total energy costs just below the national average, and the Tax Foundation ranks Utah’s tax climate the country’s tenth-best. A carbon-dioxide tax would do nothing to help these rankings, and would make everything more expensive for working families in Utah, leaving them less to spend and save – all without any guaranteed environmental benefits.

The following documents provide more information about carbon-dioxide taxes and fossil fuels.

The study found none of the of the six versions of the tax considered would be revenue neutral or satisfy the requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement, but each of them would reduce economic growth, impede infrastructure development, and limit the government’s ability to meet fiscal obligations and operations. People would stripped of choice and made poorer for no environmental gain.

Does a Carbon Tax Support Prosperity?

This study from the Texas Public Policy Foundation finds that research supporting the imposition of a carbon-dioxide tax are based on modeling with flawed assumptions and the tax itself would cause crippling economic costs. Two real life examples of a carbon-dioxide tax gone wrong in British Columbia and in Australia show that its potential effects include skyrocketing household electricity prices and increasing unemployment.

In this paper published by the American Enterprise Institute, Benjamin Zycher says the “conservative” Climate Leadership Council’s (CLC) much-hyped carbon-dioxide tax proposal is “naïve” and “virtually all of the … assertions in support of its proposal are incorrect or implausible.” The CLC’s plan is “poor conceptually and deeply unserious,” wrote Zycher.

Legislating Energy Poverty: A Case Study of How California’s and New York’s Climate Change Policies Are Increasing Energy Costs and Hurting the Economy

https://www.pacificresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LegislatingEnergy_F_Web.pdf

This analysis from Wayne Winegarden of the Pacific Research Institute shows the big government approach to fighting climate change taken by California and New York hits working class and minority communities the hardest. The paper reviews the impact of global warming policies adopted in California and New York, such as unrealistic renewable energy goals, strict low carbon fuel standards, and costly subsidies for buying higher-priced electric cars and installing solar panels. The report finds that, collectively, these expensive and burdensome policies are dramatically increasing the energy burdens of their respective state residents.

This paper from the Texas Public Policy Foundation examines how the United States achieved robust economic growth while dramatically reducing emissions of air pollutants. The paper states that these achievements should be celebrated as a public policy success story, but instead the prevailing narrative among political and environmental leaders is one of environmental decline that can only be reversed with a more stringent regulatory approach. Instead, the paper urges for the data to be considered and applied to the narrative.

The Case Against a U.S. Carbon Tax

https://heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/the-case-against-a-us-carbon-tax

In this paper from the Cato Institute, Robert P. Murphy, Patrick J. Michaels, and Paul C. Knappenberger examine carbon-dioxide tax programs in place in Australia and British Columbia and consider whether similar programs would be successful in the United States. They conclude, “In theory and in practice, economic analysis shows that the case for a U.S. carbon tax is weaker than its most vocal supporters have led the public to believe.”

Economic Outcomes of a U.S. Carbon Tax

This report from the National Association of Manufacturers evaluates the potential impacts carbon-dioxide taxes whose revenues would be devoted to a combination of debt and tax rate reduction would have on the U.S. economy. The results consider the varied economic effects of fossil-fuel cost increases caused by carbon taxes, as well as the positive economic effects of the assumption that carbon-dioxide tax revenues would be used to reduce government debt and federal taxes.

The Carbon Tax Shell Game

https://heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/the-carbon-tax-shell-game

Oren Cass of the Manhattan Institute argues the carbon-dioxide tax is a shell game. The range of designs, prices, rationales, and claimed benefits varies so widely that assessing the validity of most proposals is nearly impossible to accomplish. In this article for National Affairs, Cass says the effect of carbon-dioxide taxes on emissions has proven to be insubstantial, a fact he says is ignored by the tax’s proponents when promoting its purported benefits.

The Social Benefits of Fossil Fuels

https://heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/the-social-benefits-of-fossil-fuels

This Heartland Policy Brief by Joseph Bast and Peter Ferrara documents the many benefits from the historic and still ongoing use of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are lifting billions of people out of poverty, reducing all the negative effects of poverty on human health, and vastly improving human well-being and safety by powering labor-saving and life-protecting technologies, such as air conditioning, modern medicine, and cars and trucks. They are dramatically increasing the quantity of food humans produce and improving the reliability of the food supply, directly benefiting human health. Further, fossil fuel emissions are possibly contributing to a “Greening of the Earth,” benefiting all the plants and wildlife on the planet.

Research & Commentary: Proposed Utah Low-Emission Vehicles Tax Credit Program Would Be Costly and Unnecessary,Tim Benson,"Legislation introduced in the Utah House of Representatives would establish a program to offer an annual tax credit for the purchase of an electric vehicle, a plug-in hybrid, or hydrogen vehicles with a sales price under $55,000.

Purchasers of a new qualifying vehicle would be eligible for a $3,000 tax credit, while purchasers of a used qualifying vehicle would receive a $2,000 credit. Lessees would receive a $1,500 credit. Qualifying new motorcycles would also come with a $1,500 credit, while a $1,000 credit would be issued for qualifying used motorcycles purchases or the lease of a qualifying motorcycle.

The push for broad-based adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and low-emission vehicles (LEVs) through programs like the one featured in this piece of legislation will likely only increase pollution and environmental costs, according to a May 2018 study from the Manhattan Institute. “Based on data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA),” the study notes, “increased reliance on ZEVs will increase overall emissions of sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates, compared with the same number of new internal combustion vehicles, even after accounting for emissions from petroleum refineries.”

Furthermore, there is effectively no economic value to the potential carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission reductions of ZEVs. “Although new ZEVs will reduce CO 2 emissions compared with new internal combustion vehicles, the overall reduction will be less than 1% of total forecast energy-related U.S. CO 2 emissions through 2050,” the study continues. “That reduction will have no measurable impact on world climate and thus no economic value.”

“Even if, by 2050, all internal combustion vehicles were replaced by ZEVs,” the study concludes, “the resulting reduction in CO 2 emissions would be less than 500 million tons per year. This is less than half the estimated annual impact of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s now-moribund Clean Power Plan, which itself would have had no impact on world climate.”

The exorbitant cost of federal and state subsidies for ZEVs and their charging infrastructure is also highlighted in the study. In California alone, costs are estimated to exceed $100 billion, which will primarily be funded by low-income and middle-class families. Ironically, these families are unlikely to own ZEVs due to their high costs. In the end, mostly wealthy Golden State residents are benefitting from the taxpayer subsidies, and this will remain true for wealthy Utahans.

A 2013 study from the University of California at Davis found 83 percent of California ZEV owners had household incomes exceeding $100,000, with 46 percent earning incomes above $150,000. The average Tesla owner was found to have a household income of $293,000 that same year. A more recent study by the Pacific Research Institute found 79 percent of electric vehicle plug-in tax credits were claimed by households with adjusted gross incomes greater than $100,000.

The questionable, meager environmental gains to be achieved by adopting tax breaks and subsidies encouraging the broad-based adoption of ZEVs and LEVs are far outweighed by the extraordinary cost to vehicle owners and taxpayers. Such government subsidies and incentives make for poor public policy because they encourage rent-seeking, subvert the market’s natural mechanism for matching supply with demand at the correct price, and clash with other government incentives, all of which creates adverse fiscal consequences.

The following documents provide more information about ZEVs and fossil fuels.

Testimony Before the Hawaii House Committee on Energy & Environmental Protection Regarding HB 2278,Tim Benson,"Testimony Before the Hawaii House Committee on Energy & Environmental Protection Regarding HB 2278

Tim Benson, Policy Analyst

The Heartland Institute

February 8, 2022

Chairwoman Lowen and Members of the Committee:

Thank you for holding a hearing on HB 2278, which would establish a carbon-dioxide tax on all fossil fuels emitted or sold by distributors in Hawaii.

My name is Tim Benson, and I am a policy analyst with The Heartland Institute. The Heartland Institute is a 37-year-old independent, national, nonprofit organization whose mission is to discover, develop, and promote free-market solutions to social and economic problems. Heartland is headquartered in Illinois and focuses on providing national, state, and local elected officials with reliable and timely research and analysis on important policy issues.

HB 2278 would establish a “state environmental response, energy, carbon emissions, and food security tax” that would be charged “on each barrel or fractional part of a barrel of petroleum product sold by a distributor to any retail dealer or end user of petroleum product, other than a refiner.” This includes gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, butane, propane, aviation gas and jet fuel, and liquified petroleum gas.

The tax would also incrementally increase through 2035. For example, the tax on gasoline would begin at $5.27 per barrel in 2023 and top out at $33.16 per barrel in 2035, while the tax on diesel fuel would begin at $5.95 per barrel in 2023 and rise to $38.37 per barrel in 2035. (Propane would go from $3.80 to $21.97, butane from $4.26 to $25.44, kerosene from $5.93 to $38.15, jet fuel from $4.68 to $35.65, and aviation gas from $3.99 to $30.39, respectively.)

Included in the carbon-dioxide tax portion of the bill is a tax credit intended to “mitigate the effect of a carbon emissions tax on taxpayers.” Single tax filers would receive a $65 tax credit in 2023 that would gradually rise to $480 in 2035. Married filers would receive $130 in 2023 and $960 in 2035.

These credits are necessary because carbon-dioxide taxes are inherently regressive and disproportionally harm low-income families. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found a $28-per-ton carbon tax would result in energy costs being 250 percent higher for the poorest one-fifth of households than the richest one-fifth of households.[1]

CBO reports the reason for cost discrepancy is “a carbon tax would increase the prices of fossil fuels in direct proportion to their carbon content. Higher fuel prices, in turn, would raise production costs and ultimately drive up prices for goods and services throughout the economy … Low-income households spend a larger share of their income on goods and services whose prices would increase the most, such as electricity and transportation.”

A 2013 report by the National Association of Manufacturers estimates a $20-per-ton carbon-dioxide tax in Hawaii would result in a 5.3 percent increase in household electricity rates. Additionally, the tax would raise gasoline prices by more than 20 cents per gallon in just the first year alone.[2] In July 2012, Australia established a nation-wide carbon-dioxide tax set at $23 (Australian dollars) per ton and repealed it just two years later after it produced the highest quarterly increase in household electricity prices in the country’s history.[3]

One other substantial problem with the carbon-dioxide tax is that it would produce an insignificant environmental benefit, as a country-wide carbon tax that completely reduces U.S. emissions to zero by 2050 would only avert global temperature by just 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2100.[4] A state-based carbon dioxide tax would have even less impact on global temperature.

Any environmental benefits that it might produce would be effectively meaningless without concomitant legislation enacted throughout the rest of the globe. In a December 2015 speech to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, former Secretary of State John Kerry said, “The fact is that even if every American citizen biked to work, carpooled to school, used only solar panels to power their homes, if we each planted a dozen trees, if we somehow eliminated all of our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, guess what—that still wouldn’t be enough to offset the carbon pollution coming from the rest of the world.”[5]

As Oren Cass, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, noted in National Affairs, “The effectiveness of a carbon tax as a matter of environmental policy [depends] not only on how it would directly alter the trajectory of [local] emissions but also on its ability to affect global emissions by driving globally applicable technological innovation or by influencing the behavior of foreign governments. On each of these dimensions, the carbon tax fails.”[6]

At 27.55 cents per kilowatt hour, retail electricity prices in Hawaii are already 160 percent higher than the national average and are by far the highest of any state in the country.[7] Gasoline prices, currently $4.41 per gallon on average across the islands, are the second-highest in the country, while diesel prices are also currently the second-highest in the country at $4.74 per gallon.[8] Think of what this massive tax increase would mean for gas prices. Are you sure this rebate will be able to cover just this increase in costs for a low-income family?

Think also of what this massive increase in taxes on jet fuel could mean for the state’s tourism industry. How many potential visitors will be priced out of a visit to these beautiful islands because airfare is too expensive? Why pay so much extra to fly to Hawaii when they can always spend their tourist dollars in Mexico or the Caribbean? How many Hawaiians themselves will forego a trip to or from the mainland to visit family because the costs are just too prohibitive?

Therefore, Hawaii legislators should refrain from taking any self-defeating action, such as this tax, that would increase costs, especially when Hawaii’s overall tax climate is already one of the ten worst in the nation.[9] This tax would make everything more expensive for working families in Hawaii, drive up costs for businesses, and have an insignificant effect on global carbon dioxide emissions.

Mahalo.

"Biden Energy Policies Cost U.S. Households More than $1,000 in 2021","Linnea Lueken, James Taylor","KEY POINTS

DURING THE PAST YEAR:

Overall electricity prices rose 8 percent

Industrial electricity prices rose 15 percent

Home heating oil prices increased by 43 percent

Oil prices rose 60 percent

Natural gas prices surged by 61 percent

The price of gasoline rose 98 cents per gallon, about 42 percent

Energy prices are skyrocketing under President Joe Biden’s radical energy and climate agenda. The latest official government data show large year-over-year price hikes for all forms of energy. During the past year, overall electricity prices rose 8 percent,[1] industrial energy prices increased by 15 percent,[2] home heating oil prices rose 43 percent,[3] conventional oil prices surged by 60 percent,[4] natural gas prices increased by 61 percent,[5] and gasoline prices rose nearly $1 per gallon.[6]

Average Household Paid $1,000 or More in Additional Energy Costs

The average U.S. household in 2021 spent an extra $600 in higher gasoline costs and $70 in higher electricity costs. Further, households that use natural gas spent an extra $300, on average, and those using home heating oil paid $1,000 more. Cumulatively, the average American household paid about $1,000 in higher energy costs in 2021 compared to 2020. It’s also important to note that these higher energy prices have been baked into the costs for all goods and services bought and sold in the economy, contributing to across-the-board inflation. With those costs in mind, it’s clear the Biden administration’s disastrous energy and climate policies cost the average U.S. household—directly or indirectly—much more than $1,000 over the past year.

Predictable Result of Biden’s Radical Energy and Climate Policies

Rapidly rising energy prices are no accident. They are the predictable result of Joe Biden’s war on affordable energy. There are dozens of actions the Biden administration has taken that have increased energy costs, including the following notable policies:","February 8, 2022",PUBLICATION,Heartland,https://heartland.org/publications/biden-energy-policies-cost-us-households-more-than-1000-in-2021/

This study commissioned by the Institute for Energy Research and conducted by Capital Alpha Partners uses standard scoring conventions to evaluate and model the economic impacts of carbon taxes set at a variety of dollar figures, with different phase-in durations, and with an array of revenue-recycling strategies. It finds a carbon-dioxide tax will not be pro-growth, is not an efficient revenue raiser for tax reform, depresses GDP and introduces with long-term fiscal challenges playing particular stress on the states, and is inconsistent with meeting the long-term Paris Agreement emissions reduction goals.

This report from the National Association of Manufacturers evaluates the potential impacts carbon-dioxide taxes whose revenues would be devoted to a combination of debt and tax rate reduction would have on the U.S. economy. The results consider the varied economic effects of fossil-fuel cost increases caused by carbon taxes, as well as the positive economic effects of the assumption that carbon-dioxide tax revenues would be used to reduce government debt and federal taxes.

The Carbon Tax Shell Game

https://heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/the-carbon-tax-shell-game

Oren Cass of the Manhattan Institute argues the carbon-dioxide tax is a shell game. The range of designs, prices, rationales, and claimed benefits varies so widely that assessing the validity of most proposals is nearly impossible to accomplish. In this article for National Affairs, Cass says the effect of carbon-dioxide taxes on emissions has proven to be insubstantial, a fact he says is ignored by the tax’s proponents when promoting its purported benefits.

The Social Benefits of Fossil Fuels

https://heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/the-social-benefits-of-fossil-fuels

This Heartland Policy Brief by Joseph Bast and Peter Ferrara documents the many benefits from the historic and still ongoing use of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are lifting billions of people out of poverty, reducing all the negative effects of poverty on human health, and vastly improving human well-being and safety by powering labor-saving and life-protecting technologies, such as air conditioning, modern medicine, and cars and trucks. They are dramatically increasing the quantity of food humans produce and improving the reliability of the food supply, directly benefiting human health. Further, fossil fuel emissions are possibly contributing to a “Greening of the Earth,” benefiting all the plants and wildlife on the planet.

Research & Commentary: Curbing Executive Authority to Unilaterally Join Regional Cap-and-Trade Schemes is the Right Move for Florida’s Legislature,Tim Benson,"Companion legislation has been introduced in the Florida legislature that would block Florida governors from unilaterally signing the Sunshine State on to “certain state and regional programs to regulate greenhouse gas emissions” without being given the assent of the Legislature via a vote of authorization.

The legislation reads “Notwithstanding any other law, a state agency may not adopt or enforce a state or regional program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions for the purposes of addressing changes in atmospheric temperature without specific legislative authorization, including, but not limited to…low carbon fuel standards”, as well as “plans or programs enabling regulation of or mobile stationary sources, greenhouse gas taxes or fees, or greenhouse gas trading” and “state or regional programs prompted by the participation of the United States in international treaties or executive agreements or interstate compacts or agreements.”

Certainly, most obvious in mind when thinking of the necessity of this legislation are elephant-in-the-room cap-and-trade regional compact programs such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the now-defunct Transportation and Climate Initiative (TCI), which many states were made a party to via executive fiat.

RGGI, established in 2009, is an interstate cap-and-trade program made up of the New England states, along with New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Cap-and-trade programs are systems that limit carbon-dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions by establishing a specific amount of carbon dioxide businesses or other organizations may produce and allowing additional capacity to be bought from other organizations that have not used their full production allowance. If an entity emits above the cap without purchasing additional allowances, it will suffer a financial penalty. RGGI requires power plants larger than 25 megawatts in capacity to purchase emissions allowances at auction for each ton of carbon-dioxide emissions they produce. There are a limited number of allowances issued, and these are gradually reduced each year.

TCI, an initiative pushed by the Georgetown Climate Center, was based on California’s cap-and-trade program and the RGGI consortium of states. The purpose of TCI was to reduce CO 2 emissions from cars and trucks to head off climate change. It would have done this by placing a cap on gasoline and diesel fuel allowed for sale in the states participating in the program. This would have increased the price at the pump for these fuels, discouraging consumers from buying them.

Gradually, the amount of these fuels allowed for sale would have been reduced while wholesalers would have had to purchase CO 2 allowances to stay in business. TCI’s initial goal was to reduce CO 2 emissions from transportation fuels by 25 percent by 2032.

Joining such a program as RGGI would be a terrible for Floridians, as cap-and-trade programs do little to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Even worse, they are basically regressive taxes, as these programs disproportionally burden low-income households, many of whom can’t afford the higher energy and gasoline costs these programs are designed to produce. The more someone pays at the pump means the less they can afford to save or use for food, rent, mortgage payments, utility bills, etc.

A Manhattan Institute study estimates the California cap-and-trade program raised residential electricity costs by as much as $540 million in 2013. California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) estimates cap-and-trade will have increased gasoline prices by 15–63 cents per gallon by 2021, and by 24–73 cents per gallon by 2031. LAO projected Californians will spend an additional $2 billion to $8 billion on gasoline by 2021. It also estimates the increased gasoline prices will cost $150–$550 per household by 2026. Retail electricity prices in the Golden State are also 70 percent higher than the national average. Prior to the enaction of its cap-and-trade program, they were only 40 percent higher.

In a Cato Journal article released in 2018, David T. Stevenson of Delaware’s Caesar Rodney Institute writes there are “no added reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, or associated health benefits, from the RGGI program. RGGI emission reductions are consistent with national trend changes caused by new EPA power plant regulations and lower natural gas prices. The comparison requires adjusting for increases in the amount of power imported by the RGGI states, reduced economic growth in RGGI states, and loss of energy intensive industries in the RGGI states from high electric rates.”

Cap-and-trade programs like RGGI simply aren’t needed; carbon-dioxide emissions are already dropping in the United States, a development that is primarily due to the recent hydraulic fracturing revolution, which many cap-and-trade supporters continue to oppose, and the switch from coal-generated electricity to natural gas.

Curbing executive authority to prevent governors from unilaterally tying these cap-and-trade millstones to the neck of Floridians is the right move for the Legislature to take. While joining these programs or others of their ilk would have no benefit for the Sunshine State, the place for that debate to be had is in the Legislature, by the representatives of the people. If a current or future governor would like to enlist Florida in the climate crusade, let them do so not by a simple Caesarean edict, but only after they have earned the support of the legislative branch as well.

The following documents provide more information about RGGI and cap-and-trade programs.

This analysis from Wayne Winegarden of the Pacific Research Institute shows the big government approach to fighting climate change taken by California and New York hits working class and minority communities the hardest. The paper reviews the impact of global warming policies adopted in California and New York, such as unrealistic renewable energy goals, strict low carbon fuel standards, and costly subsidies for buying higher-priced electric cars and installing solar panels. The report finds that, collectively, these expensive and burdensome policies are dramatically increasing the energy burdens of their respective state residents.

This paper from the Texas Public Policy Foundation examines how the United States achieved robust economic growth while dramatically reducing emissions of air pollutants. The paper states that these achievements should be celebrated as a public policy success story, but instead the prevailing narrative among political and environmental leaders is one of environmental decline that can only be reversed with a more stringent regulatory approach. Instead, the paper urges for the data to be considered and applied to the narrative.

Florida: Where ESG goes to die,Christopher Talgo,"Florida governor Ron DeSantis is a time-tested warrior when it comes to fighting wokeness. As DeSantis is prone to say: “Florida is where woke goes to die.”

Now, DeSantis can also brag that Florida is where ESG goes to die.

On May 2, DeSantis signed a landmark bill designed “to protect Floridians from the corporatist environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) movement — a worldwide effort to inject woke political ideology across the financial sector, placing politics above the fiduciary duty to make the best financial decisions for beneficiaries.”

Specifically, the new law:

“Stops financial institutions from discriminating against customers for their religious, political, or social beliefs — like owning a firearm, securing the border, or increasing our energy independence.” “Bans the financial sector from considering so called ‘Social Credit Scores’ in banking and lending practices aimed to prevent Floridians from obtaining financial services like loans, lines of credit, and bank accounts.” “Blocks the use of ESG in all investment decisions at the state and local level, ensuring that only financial factors are considered to maximize the return on investment, protecting retirees and taxpayers alike.” “Prohibits state and local governments from using ESG as part of the procurement and contracting process.” And, “Eliminates consideration of ESG factors by state and local governments when issuing bonds.”

Although most Americans are not intimately familiar with ESG, they should be, because like it or not, ESG is coming down the pike. And, if the advocates of ESG have it their way, it will fundamentally alter the U.S. economy and society — for the worse.

In general, ESG seeks to replace shareholder capitalism with what is known as “stakeholder” capitalism.

Under shareholder capitalism, a company’s number one priority is to produce high-quality goods and services that customers want at the most affordable price. This is called the profit motive, and it is the essence of capitalism.

Under stakeholder capitalism, companies oblige the interests of all “stakeholders,” such as investors, owners, employees, vendors, customers, and the general public at large. According to the tenets of stakeholder capitalism, profit is not a company’s primary concern; social justice advocacy is paramount.

ESG is a central element of the stakeholder capitalism revolution because it steers capital towards companies that are aligned with woke causes, especially when it comes to the proliferation of so-called “equity” enterprises; “green” energy projects; Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives; Critical Race Theory; and many other sinister leftist goals.

Incredibly, ESG has infiltrated and infected a broad swath of the U.S. economy in a rather short period of time. This includes heavyweights in the banking and finance industry, most Fortune 500 companies, and a slew of medium-sized businesses.

However, there is reason for optimism.

First, ESG is literally failing. According to the Harvard Business Review, “ESG funds certainly perform poorly in financial terms… The conclusion to be drawn from this evidence seems pretty clear: funds investing in companies that publicly embrace ESG sacrifice financial returns without gaining much, if anything, in terms of actually furthering ESG interests.”

Second, research is emerging that shows ESG is a threat to individual liberty. As my colleague Jack McPherrin notes in “Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Scores: A Threat to Individual Liberty, Free Markets, and the U.S. Economy,” “ESG has proven to dramatically reduce individual liberty. ESG eviscerates individualism by attempting to restrict personal choice and tear down the meritocratic approach to societal advancement, in favor of the Orwellian DEI policies that find their basis in the pseudoscience of critical theory. Basing financial and business decisions on these constructs restricts opportunities for those whom the elite deem ‘undesirable.’ ESG is nothing more than a mechanism for social engineering and control.”

Third, more and more, states are passing anti-ESG bills. As Harvard Law School notes, “at least seven states have enacted laws or adopted regulatory action in the form of policy statements or directives that seek to prohibit or discourage public entities from considering ESG factors when investing state resources.”

Of course, this does not mean that the war against ESG is won. This is just the opening battle.

However, it does demonstrate that there is an organic groundswell of support against the top-down implementation of ESG. And, it shows that ESG is not inevitable.

To truly stop ESG in its tracks, more governors will need to muster the courage to push back against the woke industrial complex and its ESG tentacles, a la Gov. DeSantis.","May 17, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/florida-where-esg-goes-to-die/
California Will Be Exploiting Developing Countries to Achieve 1.8 Million EV Trucks,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The supply chain for minerals needed for EV batteries are dominated by China and developing countries

We all know by now that the California Air Resources Board has banned the sale of traditional combustion trucks – that run of diesel – by 2036 in the state. California now requires fully electric truck fleets. Recently, CARB unanimously adopted its Advanced Clean Fleets regulation phasing in mandates for medium- and heavy-duty truck operators in California to buy 100 percent zero-emission vehicles and remove from their fleets internal combustion engine vehicles at the end of their useful life.

What we don’t know is that this regulation will come at the expense of the developing countries that are the basis of the supply chain of EV battery materials. California’s actions support exploitation of cheap, disposable workforces in other countries and environmental degradation at countries outside the California “air bubble”.

According to most recent data, there were approximately 1.8 million diesel trucks in California in 2021. Of these, around 1.5 million were heavy-duty trucks, while the remaining 300,000 were medium-duty trucks. Most diesel trucks were owned by businesses, with only a small percentage owned by individuals.

California is home to the largest diesel truck market in the United States. These trucks are used for a variety of purposes, including transportation of goods and services, construction, and agriculture. While diesel trucks are an essential part of the state’s economy, they also contribute significantly to air pollution.

Back in 2021, I co-authored the Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy. The book does an excellent job of discussing the lack of transparency to the world of the green movement’s impact upon humanity exploitations in the developing countries that are mining for the exotic minerals and metals required to create the batteries needed to store “green energy”.

In these developing countries, these mining operations exploit child labor, and are responsible for the most egregious human rights’ violations of vulnerable minority populations. These operations are also directly destroying the planet through environmental degradation.

One year later in 2022, President Biden provided validation to the books’ message when the Biden administration declared October 4, 2022, that batteries from China may be tainted by child labor, The lithium, cobalt, and rare earth minerals needed to make batteries mostly come from places such as China, Congo, Indonesia, Iran, and other countries that are noted for gross human rights violations, and are often mined and produced using forced and child labor.

I’m sure that neither Governor Newsom nor CARB had a chance to view the 2006 movie “Blood Diamond” starring Leonardo DiCaprio that portrays many of the similar atrocities now occurring in pursuit of the “Blood Minerals” i.e., those exotic minerals and metals to support the “green” movement within wealthy countries.

Newsom and CARB lack some energy literacy which may be the reasons they avoid conversations about the ugly side of “green” mandates and regulations. They should read the Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations”, and decide for themselves if they wish to financially support the environmental degradation and humanity atrocities among folks with yellow, brown, and black skin occurring in developing countries, so that the wealthy countries can go green.

It is surprising the Newsom and CARB members support subsidies to procure EV’s and build more wind and solar when those subsidies are providing financial incentives to the developing countries mining for those “green” materials that promotes further exploitations of poor people in developing countries. I personally thought that Newsom and CARB had higher moral and ethical standards that would stop them from exploiting the poor in developing countries.

A battery in an electric car, like an average Tesla, is made of about 750-1,000 pounds of minerals, that had to be mined and processed into a battery that merely stores electricity.

EVs are environmental rapists. Mining and refining the minerals needed to make EV batteries is also an environmental disaster, inflicting environmental degradation on local landscapes in developing countries with minimal environmental regulations.

The EV battery needs for large diesel trucks with extended mileage ranges may be 3 to 4 times greater than that of a small Tesla EV.

Here is a summary of the minerals needed for a Tesla EV battery and the projected humongous needs of the minerals to support 1.8 million Diesel Truck EV’s:

Minerals needed for a Tesla EV battery Minerals needed for a large Truck EV (at least 3 times larger than a Tesla Minerals to support the needs for 1.8 million Truck EV’s Lithium 25 lbs. 75 lbs. 135,000,000 lbs.

Almost 2 Billion pounds of just minerals, plus the aluminum, steel and plastic ! 50 years after the oil embargo crisis of 1973, there is no American policy for energy independence. America continues to INCREASE its energy dependence on China for “green”, and on OPEC and Russia for oil. Today, with LESS energy independence than 1973, America is more vulnerable to another embargo than we were 50 years ago!

As World War I and II historians, Russia, China, and OPEC know, the country that controls the minerals, crude oil, and natural gas, controls the world! They all know there is no substitute for the dominance of products from fossil fuels in the foreseeable future, even on a longer-term horizon.

How Much Wind Killing Do We Want?,David Wojick,"That rapidly growing wind power development kills birds in ever increasing numbers is clear. That it also kills whales and other marine mammals is becoming clear. So the policy question is how much killing is enough, before we stop killing more? This question seems not to be asked.

The stampede to build huge amounts of wind power, on land and at sea, is potentially devastating to a great many species. Our focus has been on the growing threat to whales and other marine mammals from offshore industrial wind.

But this is just part of a much deeper pattern of runaway wind killing. For now let’s consider the indifference of the Biden Administration to land based killing of birds.

To begin with there is the golden eagle. This majestic species is the largest bird of prey in western North America, where wind development is growing rapidly. Its population is much smaller than the familiar bald eagle and may be diminishing.

The golden eagle is protected under the Eagle Act, just as the whales are under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Wind facilities require so-called “incidental take permits” for killing golden eagles issued by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).

Turns out there is a problem, namely the wind industry is ignoring the Eagle Law and not getting the required permits. I am not making this up. Here is how the FWS puts it:

“For golden eagles, a goal of the 2016 Eagle Rule was to increase compliance and improve consistency and efficiency relating to permitting golden eagle take at wind-energy projects. However, those goals have not been realized. While participation in the permit program by wind energy projects has increased since 2016, it still remains well below our expectations. Low application rates and permit-processing requirements that some have perceived as burdensome have resulted in few permits being issued for wind projects as compared to the number of operational wind projects in areas where golden eagles occur. As a result, golden eagles continue to be taken without implementation of conservation actions to offset that take.”

So few permits are being issued to wind projects that threaten golden eagles and there are a lot of those.

Is the Biden FWS threatening a crackdown on this wanton lawlessness? Not at all. Instead they propose to make permitting easier by making it less effective. Endless billions of dollars worth of wind projects think eagle kill permitting is too “burdensome” so the Biden bunch propose to ease up on them. Damn the eagles, full speed ahead.

In fact the FWS proposal is to do away with site specific permits and instead create a “general permit” that covers all normal wind projects. All a billion dollar project has to do is sign up and pay a tiny fee, which supposedly somehow mitigates the upcoming eagle deaths.

As part of this general permit the eagle killing is exempt from NEPA, or rather the entire project is as long as eagle killing is all they are doing. No EIS certainly speeds things up, but not in a good way for the eagles.

Also the requirement that an independent observer count the dead eagles is gone in the general permit. We will just depend on the wind facility operators (who have not been getting permits) to tell us when they have killed too many birds.

Clearly this is a huge policy move that favors wind development at the expense of the eagles. Biden said that every federal agency should do whatever it can to promote renewables and this proposal meets that test.

Beyond the eagles, which are relatively small in number, there lie the rest of the dead birds. Wind turbines are called “bird choppers” for good reason. How many birds are we talking about killing?

Interestingly there was a lot of research on this question a decade ago, when wind just started winding up, but very little today. A good example is a 2013 paper titled “Estimates of bird collision mortality at wind facilities in the contiguous United States”, Biological Conservation, Volume 168, December 2013, Pages 201-209.

See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320713003522

They estimated about 250,000 bird deaths a year. With around 50,000 MW of installed capacity, that is roughly 5 deaths per MW per year. That is already a lot if dead birds, but it gets much worse when we look ahead at the Biden Administration’s goal of “net zero” emissions.

I recently wrote about a new Tesla analysis of the renewable power requirements for net zero. These are enormous because in addition to providing power when the sun shines and the wind blows hard, they have to make enough hydrogen to generate our juice when it doesn’t.

Tesla says we will need a whopping 2 million MW of wind capacity for net zero. At five bird deaths per MW that is an incredible 10 million deaths a year. This would be something like 300 million dead birds over the combined 30 year lives of the FWS proposed general permits.

It could be many more when the endless forest of bird choppers makes avoidance impossible. We really need some research into this horrendous prospect.

The vast majority of these dead birds will be songbirds. It is ironic that the environmental movement first took off with Carson’s “Silent Spring”, which warned about the potential extermination of songbirds. Now that we are rushing headlong into environmental industrialization it appears we have come full circle.

It is time to ask the policy question: How much wind killing do we want? Or put another way, how much is too much?","May 10, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/how-much-wind-killing-do-we-want/
An Easy Guide to Rational Energy Policies,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The elephant in the room is a supply chain backup plan for products now supporting humanity that is required before we electrify the world.

There are extensive technical and lengthy discussions and proposed solutions, both pros and cons, about climate change, rising oceans, extreme weather events, the impact of emissions, net-zero, EV mandates, wind and solar mandates, pollution, temperature change, and energy subsidies.

The elephant in the room that is seldom discussed is the simple and easy to understand fact of life that the world is facing shortages of the same products and fuels manufactured from crude oil that were the basis of the planets’ population growth from one to eight billion in less than two hundred years.

A non-technical explanation for these upcoming shortages is that wind turbines and solar panels can only generate electricity but cannot manufacture any products for humanity.

With no backup plan to maintain the supply chain for all the products and fuels supporting the eight billion on this planet, the following should be helpful for new regulations, mandates, and laws that would restore sensible, affordable, and rational energy policies.

Whereas, wind turbines and solar panels only generate electricity, but manufacture no products for humanity.

And whereas, ridding the world of fossil fuels would result in a reduction in each of the following, as all these infrastructures exist because of the products manufactured from crude oil, that cannot be manufactured by either wind turbines or solar panels.

Infrastructures that did not exist before 1800 Manufactured from fossil fuels Manufactured from wind and solar 1 Products for medications and medical equipment at pharmacies and hospitals. Yes No 2 The tires for the billions of vehicles. Yes No 3 Products and fuels for number of cruise ships that now move twenty-five million passengers around the world. Yes No 4 Products and fuels for the space program. Yes No 5 Products and fuels for the 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range merchant ships that are moving products throughout the world. Yes No 6 Products and fuels for 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range jets used by commercial airlines, private usage, and the military. Yes No 7 Products for communications systems, including cell phones, computers, iPhones, and iPads. Yes No 8 Products for water filtration systems. Yes No 9 Products for the sanitation systems. Yes No 10 Products for wind turbines and solar panels as they are all made with products from fossil fuels. Yes No 11 The asphalt for the millions of miles of roadways. Yes No 12 The fertilizers that come from natural gas help feed billions. Yes No 13 The pesticides to control locusts and other pests. Yes No

And whereas that today, 700 oil refineries around the world are designed for specific crude oil feedstocks available to those sites, and then manufacture each 42-gallon barrel of oil into light and heavy hydrocarbon products available from that feedstock to support the world’s 8 billion on this planet that are dependent on the 50,000 jets moving people and products, and more than 50,000 merchant ships for global trade flows, and the militaries of each country, and space programs that are based on the heavy hydrocarbons for the various fuels manufactured from crude oil.

And whereas those light hydrocarbons are primarily used for making the more than 6,000 products for humanity and the infrastructures that did not exist before 1800.

And whereas, to achieve a world of only those light ends to make all the products now in society that supports lifestyles and all the infrastructures, there are thoughts among the green community that we can convert the existing old refineries to produce nothing but derivatives, and/or replace the existing refineries with derivative refineries, or just manufacturing those light ends. That may be another pipe dream as each refinery is designed for specific crude oil feedstocks available to those sites, and conversions may be technically too expensive and not even permittable.

And whereas, a 42-gallon barrel of oil contains about 90 percent of heavy hydrocarbons for various fuels, and about 10 percent of light hydrocarbons that are the basis of thousands of products made from those oil derivatives by -products. We can’t squeeze more light-end hydrocarbons from a barrel of oil.

And whereas, that such a switch of those old refineries to derivative refineries is a pipedream or an environmental and emissions disaster as 90 percent of that 42-gallon barrel of crude oil would need to be disposed of if not marketable as manufactured products like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), automotive gasolines, jet fuels, distillate fuel oils, diesel fuels.

1 to 8 billion in 200 years, because they can be manufactured into thousands of usable, life-enhancing and life-saving products.

And whereas, the sites for the mining of materials required to build wind, solar, and EV batteries exist in developing countries that are under minimal to nonexistent labor, wage, environmental, reclamation, and worker health and safety regulations. The mere extraction of those exotic minerals presents social challenges, human rights abuses, and environmental degradations worldwide, but are of no significance to the wealthy countries benefiting from those “green” materials.

And whereas, the climate cult COULD seek decommissioning and restoration standards in those developing countries down to the last dandelion, just like we have for decommissioned mines, oil, and nuclear sites in America, but the climate cult avoids the same in developing countries.

And whereas, the life cycle for electricity from wind turbines and solar runs from design, procurement, and construction, through operations and maintenance, and repair, as well as the life ending decommissioning and disposal, but again, recycling and restoration of the landscaping back to its original pristine condition, is also not in the cards in the wealthy countries that are going green.

And whereas, that ridding the world of oil, without a replacement in mind, would be immoral and evil, as extreme shortages of the products manufactured from fossil fuels which are supporting the 8 billion on this planet will result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths. Shortages of fossil fuel products would necessitate lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s and could be the greatest threat to the planet’s eight billion residents.

Before implementation of any policies that impact the supply chain of crude oil, a replacement must be identified that can maintain the supply chain of more than 6,000 products and various fuels that support the health and food requirements of the 8 billion now on this planet and the 50,000 merchant ships and 50,000 jets that are moving products around the world for global trade flows, and the military and space programs.","May 9, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/an-easy-guide-to-rational-energy-policies/
PRESS RELEASE: Save The Whales Coalition Warns NOAA: Don’t Allow More Harassment from Wind Power,"H. Sterling Burnett, David T. Stevenson, Craig Rucker","‘With dozens of dead whales and dolphins washing up … now is a particularly unsuitable time for NOAA to authorize the harassment or injury of right whales and other endangered species.’

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (May 2, 2023) – The Save the Whale Coalition – consisting of The Heartland Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and the American Coalition for Ocean Protection (ACOP) sent a letter today to the National Marine Fisheries Service, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), warning them not to authorize the harassment of whales requested by Dominion Energy of Virginia.

Dominion Energy recently submitted a “Request for Rulemaking and Letter of Authorization for Taking of Marine Mammals” as dead whales have been increasingly washing ashore along the Atlantic Coast. The Save the Whale Coalition says that NOAA granting Dominion’s request would prompt litigation to stop it.

Dominion’s request, issued in August, asks NOAA for permission to begin construction of “all offshore project components,” including turbines, monopiles, substations, and underwater cables “no later than March 4, 2024 and to extend for five years.” The company also requests the “unintentional (but not unexpected) taking of protected species,” including the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, of which only around 300 remain.

The Coalition notes in its letter that the project will be subject to judicial review for a period of time substantially beyond the March 4, 2024 time frame, and that until that judicial review us finalized, there should be no offshore construction authorized to proceed.

The letter is signed by David Hubbard, partner in the firm of Gatzke, Dillon, and Ballance (GDB), which has been retained by the Coalition to provide advice and counsel with respect to Dominion’s offshore wind project and its compliance with federal statutes and regulations. GDB is also counsel for plaintiffs who have brought suit against the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the Department of Interior, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and other federal agencies with respect to offshore wind development in Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey.

The following statements from members of the Coalition may be used for attribution. For more comment or to schedule an interview, please contact Jim Lakely, vice president and director of communications at The Heartland Institute at [email protected] or call/text his cell: 312-731-9364.

“The Draft Environmental Impact Statement issued by BOEM for the Virginia Wind project contains numerous procedural and substantive violations of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and other federal statutes and regulations. The Coalition is warning BOEM, NOAA, and other federal agencies not to approve Dominion Energy’s recent request – which would allow the harassment and injuring of whales and other marine mammals – until all of the federal statutory requirements and regulations have been complied with and approved by appropriate federal agencies, and that permission has been obtained from all courts that have been requested to review and approve the federal permits.

“With dozens of dead whales and dolphins washing up on the shores of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia, now is a particularly unsuitable time for NOAA to authorize the harassment or injury of right whales and other endangered species. It is equally problematic for Dominion Energy to be seeking whale harassment permission at this time. Dominion Energy is attempting to put the cart before the horse. There should be no issuance of incidental harassment authority by federal agencies until the offshore construction activities to which it is ‘incidental’ have been finally approved by appropriate federal agencies and the courts.”

Craig Rucker

President, CFACT

[email protected]

“We have conferred with dozens of environmental and conservation groups from NY, MD, and NJ who are furious that all of these dead whales and dolphins should appear on their beaches immediately following the sonar blasting survey work undertaken by wind developers adjacent to these beaches. The excuse by the federal authorities that there is ‘no evidence’ connecting this sonar blasting with mammal deaths rings hollow as any federally approved harassment could send whales into major shipping channels that surround the lease areas.

“Possible death by vessel strikes of harassed whales supports our request, along with the congressional resolution sponsored by U.S. Reps. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), Chris Smith (R- NJ), Andy Harris (R-MD) and Scott Perry (R-PA), for an immediate moratorium on offshore wind development and a complete, independent investigation into the cause of all this marine mammal destruction.”

David Stevenson

President, ACOP

[email protected]

“BOEM has already admitted that it is a ‘partner’ with offshore wind developers in implementing the Biden administration’s goal of industrializing the East Coast with thousands of wind turbines. It is not acting, as it should by law, like an independent body equally as concerned with environmental protection as with the construction of expensive, unreliable, industrial wind factories.

“This request by Dominion Energy for permission to harm, injure, and kill whales and other marine mammals even before the environmental impacts, construction and operations plan, and potential biological removal for Virginia Wind have been finally issued and approved raises suspicions that the Biden administration is prepared to green light offshore wind development regardless of clear legal requirements and the obvious danger it poses to the survival of the Right Whale and other endangered species.”

The Practical Impossibility of Large-Scale Carbon Capture and Storage,Steve Goreham,"The Environmental Protection Agency is working on a new rule that would set stringent limits on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from US power plants. Utilities would be required to retrofit existing plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology or to switch to hydrogen fuel. Others call for the use of CCS to decarbonize heavy industry. But the cost of capture and the amount of CO 2 that proponents say needs to be captured crush any ideas about feasibility.

Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide from an industrial plant before it enters the atmosphere, transporting it, and storing it for centuries to millennia. Capture may be accomplished by filtering it from combustion exhaust streams. Pipelines are proposed to transport the captured CO 2 . Underground reservoirs could be used for storage. For the last two decades, advocates have proposed CCS to reduce emissions from coal plants and steel, chemical, and other hard-to-decarbonize industries in order to fight human-caused climate change.

CCS has been slow to take off due to the cost of capture and the limited salability of carbon dioxide as a product. Thirty-nine CCS facilities capture CO 2 around the world today, totaling 45 million tons per year, or about 0.1 percent of industrial emissions produced globally. Of these, 20 reside in the US or Canada, six in Europe, and five in China. Twenty-four of these facilities use captured CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery. Captured CO 2 is injected into oil wells to boost oil output,

The news from these facilities is mixed. Many are not meeting their carbon-capture goals or are incurring costs well over budget. Nevertheless, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, the US, and nations of Europe now offer billions in direct subsidies or tax breaks to firms for capture of CO 2 emissions and to build pipelines and storage. Over 300 large and small capture projects are in planning around the world which, after completion, may be able to boost capture to 0.5 percent of man-made emissions.

Illinois, Iowa, and other states are struggling with issues involving plans for CO 2 pipelines. Ethanol plants and other facilities propose to capture CO 2 and need a new network of pipelines to transport the gas to underground storage sites. These pipelines face strong opposition from local communities over farmland use and safety concerns in the case of a pipeline rupture.

Carbon capture and storage is very expensive. An example concerns plans for CCS in Wyoming, the leading US coal state. Wyoming mined 41 percent of US coal in 2020 and coal-fired plants produced about 85 percent of the state’s electricity. With abundant coal resources and good opportunities to store CO 2 underground, Wyoming appeared to be an excellent candidate to use CCS. The state passed House Bill 200 in March 2020, directing utilities to produce 20 percent of electricity from coal plants fitted with CCS by 2030.

In response to the statute, Rocky Mountain Power and Black Hills Energy, Wyoming’s two major power companies, analyzed alternatives for their operations and provided comments to the Wyoming Public Service Commission in March 2022. But the comments were not favorable for CCS. Black Hills Energy determined that adding CCS to two existing coal plants would cost an estimated $980 million, or three times the capital cost expended to build the plants. Rocky Mountain Power stated that adding CCS to its existing plants was “not economically feasible at this time.”

Beyond cost, the amount of carbon dioxide that advocates say must be captured is vast. The amount of CO 2 produced by industry is small in global terms, only about five percent of what nature releases into and absorbs from the atmosphere every day. But the amount of industrial CO 2 produced is still huge in human terms.

For example, an empty Boeing 747 jumbo jet weighs 412,300 pounds (187,000 kg). Its maximum fuel weight is 433,195 pounds (196,494 kg), more than the empty weight of the aircraft. During fuel combustion, two oxygen atoms are taken from the atmosphere and combined with each carbon atom. For each kilogram of jet fuel burned, 3.16 kilograms of carbon dioxide are created.

Consider the Drax Power Station in North Yorkshire, England, the third-largest power plant in Europe, which has been converted to using two-thirds biomass fuel. The plant is experimenting with CCS to reduce emissions. Each day, the plant uses about 20,000 tons of wood pellets delivered by 475 railroad cars. Picture the volume that these railroad cars would carry and then more than double it to get an idea of the amount of CO 2 to be captured and stored each day.

The world’s heavy industries use vast amounts of coal, natural gas, and petroleum. Ammonia, cement, plastics, steel, and other industries produce billions of tons of materials each year for agriculture, construction, health care, industry, and transportation. Capturing, transporting, and storing CO 2 from these processes would involve trillions of dollars and many decades of investment.

The International Energy Agency calls for 9 percent of the world’s CO 2 emissions to be captured and stored by 2050. Today we have a mix of 39 major and minor capture facilities in operation. The IEA estimates that 70 to 100 major capture facilities will need to come online each year until 2050 to achieve this goal. It’s unlikely that even 20 percent of the goal will be achieved, despite hundreds of billions of dollars in spending.

Your Taxes at Work: ‘Eco-Anxiety’ Counseling for Federal Workers,Paul Driessen,"US Fish and Wildlife Service employees are struggling to cope with feelings of trauma and loss over the world’s changing climates and imperiled environments. Their work repeatedly confronts them with ecological changes, but even a sense of “anticipated loss” perhaps decades from now requires compassionate help. Or so the FWS and American Psychological Association tell us.

The FWS is thus offering paid leave to employees who attend “eco-anxiety” and “climate grief” training. When the House Natural Resources Committee called the sessions a colossal waste of money, the agency downplayed their cost and scope. But naturally the “woke” programs don’t end there.

FWS Director Martha Williams is also pushing diversity-equity-inclusion-LBGTQ programs as the agency’s “number one priority” (or perhaps number two, after climate change). Employees can take as much paid time off as needed for DEI and “gay pride” programs and eco-anguish counseling.

There’s no word about programs to help employees deal with widespread habitat and wildlife destruction that will result from millions of wind turbines, billions of solar panels and tens of thousands of miles of new transmission lines, due to “net zero” policies implemented in the name of averting the “climate crisis.” Apparently no programs offer paid leave to participate in “conservative pride” campaigns or study Earth’s historic ice ages, warm periods, little ice ages and decades-long droughts.

That’s hardly surprising. The FWS and Interior Department were getting eco-centric and anti-fossil-fuel when I worked there 35 years ago. Like American and Western society in general, their culture has simply gotten more noticeably and intolerantly devoted to extreme environmentalist agendas since then.

Movies, television and news stories, constant instruction in what to think, rather than how to think, an absence of religion and ethics in many schools and homes, and incessant themes of inequality, victimhood and global doom foster widespread tension, anxiety and depression. They leave too many children, teens and adults unable to cope with life and setbacks, less respectful of authority and human life, inured to violence, and aggressively intolerant of opinions that differ from their own ideologies and agendas.

Even before they were forced to endure Covid-induced lockdowns, nearly 20% of Americans were taking antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs, some linked to precipitating acts of violence; a third of high school students experienced prolonged anxiety, depression and hopelessness; and almost one in five teenagers had contemplated suicide.

Social isolation, minimal physical and outdoor activity, video games and reading self-selected online media have amplified depression and “chronic incapacitating mental illness” in America and many Western countries. Also hardly surprising, the problems are increasingly blamed on climate change.

“Climate grief is real,” self-proclaimed experts insist, and it’s spreading rapidly among young people. “The future is frightening,” 77% of 10,000 young people ages 16-25 from the USA and other countries told “climate anxiety” and “climate depression” investigators. Many children have climate nightmares.

“The climate mental health crisis” already affects people who have “lost everything in worsening climate infernos,” claims a NASA scientist and climate activist who’s certain we face “the end of life on Earth as we know it.” He’s not alone in being convinced that every extreme weather event and ecological calamity today is due to or made worse by fossil fuel and agricultural emissions.

“I don’t want to be alive anymore,” wailed a four-year-old who’s clearly been indoctrinated already. “The animals are all going to die, and I don’t want to be here when all the animals are dead.”

Parents fantasize about killing their children, over fears of a “climate-ravaged future.” Parents, teens and even children increasingly consider suicide.

At least one psychologist has based his entire practice on addressing climate psychoses. The Climate Psychology Alliance provides an online directory of “climate-aware therapists,” and a “peer support network” offers grief therapy modeled on twelve-step drug addiction programs.

There’s only one real solution to this epidemic, other “experts” insist: Governments must “take action now” to “end the climate crisis,” to eliminate “the death knell of climate chaos” that threatens us. Otherwise the epidemic of anxiety, depression, pills, climate grief and suicide will steadily worsen.

This is nonsense, insanity. We don’t have a climate crisis. We have a climate fear-mongering crisis.

We don’t need to “fix” exaggerated and over-hyped climate problems. We need to end the junk science, the indoctrination dominating news stories and classroom discussions about energy and climate change, the censorship that prevents alternative, reality-based facts and voices from being heard, the massive government funding of one side of this crucial debate.

Claims of “unprecedented” temperatures and extreme weather, floods and droughts have no basis in real-world evidence. The “climate crisis” exists in greenhouse-gas-focused computer models, headlines and hype, not in reality. There is no unprecedented upward trend in the frequency of violent US tornados, or US landfalling hurricanes, for example – though the 12-year absence of Category 3-5 hurricanes hitting the United States between Wilma (October 2005) and Harvey (August 2017) is an all-time record.

Unfortunately, viewpoints, evidence and experts challenging climate crisis claims are too often banished from school curricula, news and social media, and government policy discussions.

President Biden’s “national climate advisor” worked closely with Big Tech and news organizations, to suppress facts about climate change, fossil fuels, and the acreage, raw materials and mining required for wind, solar and battery power. Meta (Facebook), YouTube, pre-Musk Twitter and other companies routinely help to deplatform, demonetize and censor anyone contesting crisis-promoting claims.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “summaries for policy makers” often misrepresent scientific findings and advance frightening but unsupported scenarios about Earth’s future climate. The IPCC also ignores studies that demonstrate how increased atmospheric carbon dioxide improves plant growth and wildlife habitats, how climate has changed repeatedly throughout Earth’s history, and that eliminating fossil fuels would result in extensive ecological damage from wind, solar, battery and transmission line mining and installations.

China, India and other countries are rapidly expanding their oil, gas and coal use, to improve their economies and lift billions out of poverty. China dominates raw material and “green tech” supply chains, making the West increasingly reliant on China for energy, economy and national defense needs – via Chinese mines, processing plants and factories that operate under minimal standards for pollution control, habitat destruction, and slave and child labor. As a result:

* Nothing the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia do will have any effect on global fossil fuel use or greenhouse gas emissions.

* Western foreign and domestic policy options will be restricted by reliance on adversarial nations for pseudo-renewable energy materials and technologies.

* Prices for energy, goods and services will skyrocket, because every megawatt of wind and solar must be duplicated with backup batteries or generators.

* Politicians and bureaucrats – egged on by loud, often violent mobs – will increasingly dictate our energy consumption, living standards, home sizes, vacations, and what we can eat, drink, drive and buy.

These are the real existential threats to democracy, society, humanity and planet. Parents, voters, legislators and judges concerned about our future must take action now to stop this insanity.","April 26, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/your-taxes-at-work-eco-anxiety-counseling-for-federal-workers/
"50 Years After the Oil Embargo Crisis of 1973, No American Policy for Energy Independence","Ronald Stein, P.E.","America continues to increase its energy dependence on China for “green”, and on OPEC and Russia for oil.

The oil embargo of 1973 imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other Arab oil-producing nations was imposed in response to the United States’ support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

The embargo led to a sharp increase in oil prices and a shortage of fuels for the military, airlines, ships, and vehicles in the United States and other countries, as well as a shortage of products from oil.

Few may remember the long lines at gas stations which were one of the most visible effects of the oil embargo. In some cases, people waited for hours to fill up their tanks. The shortage of oil also led to price increases, and many people were forced to make sacrifices to conserve fuel.

The oil embargo of 1973 was a major event in the history of the United States. It led to a recession in the United States and other countries. It also led to thoughts of a needed energy policy in the United States. The United States began to develop alternative sources for oil and for electricity, such as solar and wind power.

President Richard Nixon played a key role in the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which carries oil from Prudhoe Bay on Alaska’s North Slope to the port of Valdez. Nixon signed the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act into law in 1973, and he worked to overcome environmental and political opposition to the project. The pipeline began operating in 1977 and has since transported more than 15 billion barrels of oil.

President Richard Nixon gave a speech on America’s energy policy on November 7, 1973, in which he outlined his plans to reduce national energy consumption and called on U.S. citizens to follow his lead in achieving energy independence. In his speech, Nixon acknowledged that the United States was facing an oil crisis for the American economy’s demands for fuels, and the products that are based on crude oil, and he blamed the crisis on several factors, including the Arab oil embargo, the growth of the U.S. economy, and the country’s continued reliance on foreign oil.

Now, 50 years later, none of the administrations that followed Nixon have done anything to establish a policy for America’s energy independence from another embargo disaster. We’re talking about a 50-year span of administrations from Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, Bush, Jr., Obama, Trump, and now Biden.

As World War I and II historians Russia, China, and OPEC know, the country that controls the minerals, crude oil, and natural gas, controls the world! They all know there is no substitute for fossil fuel product dominance in the foreseeable future, even on a longer-term horizon. To believe a transition to just electricity from renewables is possible from the products manufactured from fossil fuels and act accordingly is suicidal for humanity. As former Congressman Don Ritter of Pennsylvania wrote “It’s the real “existential threat.”

Today, President Biden and California Governor Newsom remain oblivious to the fact that wind and solar only generate electricity. Neither Biden or Newsom can identify one product that wind and solar can manufacture for mankind. And worse, neither has a backup plan to replace all the products and fuels that are based on oil!

Biden is campaigning to rid America of oil, and Newsom, by continually decreasing California’s in-state oil production, Newsom’s personal energy policies continue to force California, the 4th largest economy in the world, to be the only state in contiguous America that imports most of its crude oil energy from foreign countries. That dependence, via maritime transportation from foreign nations for the state’s crude oil energy demands, has increased imported crude oil from 5 percent in 1992 to almost 60 percent today of total consumption. California’s growing dependency on other nations, like Saudi Aramco is a serious national security risk for America.

Today, both Biden and Newsom campaign to go green with EV’s, and wind and solar for electricity generation. Through the encouragement of tax incentives and subsidies to go green, they are providing financial incentives to China, who already controls the supply chain for the minerals and metals to go green, furthering our total dependence on China to achieve the green goals of America.

In the 1970s, Nixon also took steps to increase domestic energy production. He opened more federal lands to oil and gas drilling, and he encouraged the development of new sources for electricity, such as solar and nuclear power. He also created the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA), which was responsible for researching and developing new energy technologies.

Nixon’s energy policies were not without their critics. Some argued that his policies were too focused on conservation and not enough on production. Others argued that his policies were too expensive and that they would harm the economy. However, Nixon’s energy policies were generally successful in helping the United States to weather the energy crisis of the 1970s.

Here is a list of some of President Nixon’s energy successes in the 1970s:

Opening more federal lands to oil and gas drilling

Created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970

Created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 1970

Created the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1970

Created the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in 1972

Signing the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act into law in 1973

Creating the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1974

Passage of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975

Those 1970s agencies were created in response to several challenges facing the United States at the time, including environmental pollution, occupational safety and health hazards, and consumer product safety. The creation of those agencies helped to improve the quality of life for Americans and to protect the environment.

Today, America is offering tax incentives and subsidies to go green at any cost, and implementing policies to rid the country of oil with no backup plan for a supply chain of products from oil that are the basis of the economy. Instead of achieving energy independence, America continues to increase its dependence on China for “green”, and Russia and OPEC for oil products demanded by our economy.

Lighting the Way to More Government,Greg E. Walcher,"Light bulb jokes were popular for years as a way to poke fun at stereotypes. I remember an old one during the Reagan years, about how many Republicans it took to change a light bulb. It took one to screw in the bulb, one to steady the chandelier, one to claim the bulb wasn’t truly needed, and one to reminisce about the old bulb.

A number of pundits are reminiscing this month about old light bulbs, because the Biden Administration announced it is finalizing the federal ban on incandescent bulbs. The breakthrough invention of Thomas Edison that brought civilization out of the whale oil age and transformed the lives of billions – the light bulb that became the iconic image to illustrate a good idea – is now considered one of many everyday conveniences that are destroying the planet. Some commentators express outrage that the government would dictate such ordinary consumer products, but that ship sailed 13 years ago, in 2010.

That’s when the federal government announced that the sale or import of incandescent light bulbs would be banned, effective in 2014. Congressional Republicans thrice made half-hearted efforts to repeal the ban by tacking riders onto spending bills, including one at the end of 2014. Those riders never repealed the ban, but simply stopped the Department of Energy (DOE) from enforcing the restriction on sales, until the next spending bill. But most stores had to quit selling regular bulbs anyway because manufacturers quit making them. General Electric (GE) was the dominant manufacturer at the time, but closed its last incandescent bulb factory, laying off thousands of workers in West Virginia.

GE became the government’s partner in the move to ban incandescent light bulbs because the newer technology was much more expensive, and thus more profitable. Sylvania, Philips, and other manufacturers followed GE’s lead and the ban became reality, DOE’s suspended enforcement authority notwithstanding.

It is worth noting that the “new technology” at the time was different than today. In 2010 the move was toward compact fluorescent lights (CFLs), the little spiral-shaped bulbs that are rarely seen today. That’s because the government could never figure out what to do with the bulbs

when they burned out (besides reminiscing). Incandescent bulbs could simply be thrown away, but not the CFL bulbs. The government said they had to be recycled carefully because they contained mercury. In fact, everyone made fun of the government’s official advice about what to do if a CFL accidentally broke: everyone must immediately leave the house by some alternate route, turn off all heating and air conditioning, air out the house for at least 15 minutes, then clean up the glass and put it in a sealed container (they suggested mason jars). People were advised to throw away any clothing or bedding that may have touched any of the broken glass, and to open windows and shut off all ventilation “the next several times you vacuum.”

Needless to say, the CFL bulbs were never accepted by consumers, and became largely obsolete with the development of today’s light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs. A legal brief filed by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Institute for Energy Research, and a dozen other groups reported, “While LEDs are more efficient and generally longer-lasting… they currently cost more than incandescent bulbs and are inferior for certain functions such as dimming.” No matter, incandescent bulbs are gone from store shelves, except a few specialty bulbs like candelabra and Christmas lights.



Perhaps it is no coincidence that Biden’s DOE officials began their tirade against household appliances and light bulbs at Christmastime. With this recent announcement, empowered because Congress stopped adding the annual rider to appropriation bills, light bulbs now join gas stoves, ovens, washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, furnaces, and air conditioners on the targeted list of household appliances that must be manufactured under federal supervision. The new rule targets not only the last remaining incandescent bulbs, but also the remaining fluorescent bulbs, including the long tube kind that light stores and shops throughout the world.

It is difficult to estimate the financial impact of banning affordable lighting. Economist Steve Moore writes that fewer than half of American households currently report using mostly or exclusively LEDs. Only 39 percent of households with an income of $20,000 or less use LEDs. They are expensive, so millions of people are still using light bulbs sold more than a decade ago. As those burn out, lighting costs will increase.

Funny how every time the government regulates anything, the price goes up. That ought to shine a bright light on the cost of overregulation.","April 19, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/lighting-the-way-to-more-government/

Fact-Checking Fact-Deprived Fact Checkers

A funny thing happened on the way to Agence France-Presse’s (AFP) fact check of The Heartland Institute’s Climate at a Glance (CAAG) booklet for teachers and students. They forgot to check any facts.

The Heartland Institute developed CAAG, the booklet and website where new climate science and economic claims are being posted regularly, to provide woefully lacking balance to the climate debate in an easily accessible format. Complex material is presented in a style most middle school and high school readers can understand. The topical two-page presentations have no vitriol, no opinions, and no unverified assertions. CAAG just looks at critical scientific and economic claims that the Earth faces a human-caused climate crisis, and examines them one by one in a Joe Friday fashion: “Just the facts, ma’am.” In no way, shape, or form does CAAG claim climate change is not occurring, despite the numerous statements to the contrary made by the book’s numerous factually challenged, closed-minded critics.

CAAG presents official government data and the latest reports from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in response to assertions that climate change is causing calamities such as more severe and numerous hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, etc., or that climate change is causing mass die-offs of bees, coral reefs, polar bears, or most distressing of all, humans, or that climate change is swamping island nations and creating millions of climate refugees. The facts presented in these brief essays provide key balance to the climate crisis narrative being pushed on teachers and students by the mainstream media, scientists, and politicians who benefit in one way or another from false climate alarm.

The AFP ran two articles “fact checking” CAAG: one when we mailed it out in late February and a second in late March, the latter actually bearing the title “‘Infecting minds’: US book sent to teachers seeks to sow climate doubt.” An article claiming the points made in a science book are tantamount to an infection: How’s that for objective journalism?

As I told the Cowboy State Daily when they interviewed me for an article about AFP’s fact check, “Which fact was checked? They supposedly check facts. I don’t see a single piece of data or evidence where they checked a fact, as opposed to what they think the implication is of those facts we’re trying to get at.”

AFP’s first article did examine eight specific CAAG briefs out of the thirty in the book. In most of those cases, AFP confirmed our facts but added speculation along the lines of, “Yes, data cited in CAAG do show that X is not getting worse, but experts say in the future …” or “… computer models suggest in the future… .”

In short, AFP never disputes the facts we present but instead implies they can be explained away (“lack context”) or some experts dispute what normal people may conclude from the facts (that disaster is not on the way, for example). To be clear, computer models’ projections about the future and experts’ prognostications about what is to come are no more “facts” about the real world than are some carney side show psychic’s predictions. Climate models don’t reflect reality well. They are flawed in ways that consistently make their core projection, the temperature response to carbon dioxide, run far too hot. If their temperature claims are wrong, any projections that flow from them about trends in human health or weather extremes are likewise untenable. Experts’ opinions about the future are not facts either. CAAG, by contrast, presents facts, and they stand or fall based on the data.

Let’s look at a few examples of the AFP’s laughable fact check. Concerning crops, CAAG states, “As the climate modestly warms, global crop yields have set new records almost every year. That is due, in part, to longer growing seasons and greater concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.” Those are facts. AFP’s response: “Warmer temperatures and CO2 play a part in boosting crop yields but…” So, fact confirmed. The “but” part of the statement consists of experts claiming the trends are reversing and, based on counterfactual computer-model simulations of the past, that yields would have grown even faster but for climate change. Those are not facts, just unsubstantiated claims.

CAAG cites data from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) showing crop yields and production across all regions of the world have been regularly setting new records. Ignoring numerous peer-reviewed studies, thousands of field experiments, the experience of greenhouse operators all over the globe, and the implications of the FAO’s own data, AFP quotes an email from the FAO saying, “there was however no evidence that more CO2 in the atmosphere was good for sustainable agriculture.” Evidently that means crops grown “sustainably,” however that is defined, are not like regular plants, for which CO2 boosts growth, improves water use, and is largely responsible for a tremendous greening of the Earth. But hey, it was in an email from the FAO, so it must be true.

CAAG states, “Corals thrive in warm water, not cold water, and recent warming has allowed corals to expand their range. The primary causes of coral bleaching are not ‘global warming,’ but sediment and agricultural chemical run offs.” The AFP fact check admits the EPA confirms sedimentation as a “primary stressor” of corals and cites other local threats such as chemical runoffs.

If you feel a but… coming, that’s because it is. AFP cites experts claiming coral bleaching is becoming more common in response to warming oceans. Bleaching events, however, do not necessarily equate to coral deaths, even if driven by temperatures. Apparently AFP does not always love “context.” The evidence shows (and by evidence, I mean hard data produced by scientific surveys) that most corals recover after warming-induced bleaching; they adapt or evolve to thrive in warmer temperatures. New corals are being discovered all the time, and data show coral extent is increasing.

AFP also “fact-checked” CAAG’s claims on hurricanes. “The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found no increase in the frequency or severity of hurricanes despite modest warming,” CAAG states. That is a fact, and AFP’s own analysis confirmed our claim is accurate. But of course they had to add a scary conjecture: “As AFP has reported, the number of hurricane landfalls has not significantly risen in the United States. However, the global proportion of tropical cyclones reaching very intense (Category 4 and 5) levels is projected to increase due to human-caused warming this century, according to the NOAA.”

In case you missed it, AFP confirmed there is no increase in hurricane numbers. So, unable to refute the CAAG’s claims, AFP pivoted to a statement from an agency controlled by President Joe Biden, which says hurricanes are likely to get worse in the future. That represents what AFP evidently considers refutation of an accurate, data-driven statement. In case you were curious—which AFP evidently wasn’t—in the 35 years of warming since NASA’s James Hansen first told the U.S. Senate humans were causing global warming, hurricane intensity has declined, not increased, with the number of major hurricanes falling.

NOAA, as cited by AFP, is telling us to “trust our projections, not the lying data” and saying, “Yeah, even though the physics won’t change and hurricanes haven’t followed the script so far, we’re sure things will turn around and hurricanes will get worse.”

At Heartland, we stick with real data. A fact check should consist of confirming or refuting claims about what is, not treating as a fact what some purported expert or group says might occur at some point in the future.

Other CAAG fact checks conducted by AFP largely consist of the organization citing experts claiming the historical data on which the book based its trendlines are unreliable. In some cases, bureaucrats at federal agencies have removed public data relied on by the government itself and by top researchers to produce thousands of peer-reviewed articles over decades, saying they now don’t trust the sources for the data or their collection methods. Among the facts about which AFP makes this complaint are our reports on growing polar bear populations and declining wildfire and heat wave trends.

Recent data on polar bears is clear and indisputable: their population has increased substantially over the past few decades. As to wildfires, NASA has documented a 25 percent decline in acreage lost to wildfires globally since 2003. The modest recent uptick of wildfires in the western United States is an anomaly in global trends, not linked to climate change. It is a response to localized drought conditions combined with changed federal-government forest management practices that have increased the amount of fuel (dead trees and brush) and made it hard to suppress fires once they start. SUVs have nothing to do with it.

The experts AFP quotes to refute the hard data presented by CAAG don’t replace the datasets CAAG cites with improved datasets, so they cannot say for sure whether polar bear, wildfire, or heat wave numbers in the past were better or worse in the past than today, because there is no basis for comparison if you throw out the existing data. If they are right, the accurate claim is, “We just don’t know about trends for these phenomena,” not, “The trends have gotten worse.”

AFP and the experts it quotes should be careful about casually dismissing the accuracy of past data. Estimates of past temperatures, flood and drought frequency and severity, sea ice and glacier extent, etc., are all based on various types of proxy data taken from a relatively disparate and small group of locations or written histories. If that data is not to be trusted, we know nothing about climate before modern instrumentation and data collection methods. Is that really a road the APF and its experts want to go down? Talk about opening the door to extreme skepticism about climate change!

Despite its facade of objectivity and legitimacy, AFP’s fact check is a polemical broadside, not a serious analysis of the claims we make in the CAAG book. We at The Heartland Institute hope teachers, students, and other interested parties will see past the smoke AFP is trying to blow and will examine the book for themselves. If they do, the evidence will make for a lively debate about the causes and likely consequences of climate change.

Biden Is Financing Putin’s War Machine with His anti-American Energy Policy,James Taylor,"President Joe Biden’s policy of restricting American oil production is paying huge dividends for Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Japan announced on April 2 a new agreement to purchase prodigious amounts of oil from Russia , even though it would rather purchase the oil from the United States.

With the announcement, Japan will purchase 10% of its national oil consumption from Russia. Similarly, India and other nations have ramped up their Russian oil purchases, adding an avalanche of new funding for Putin’s war effort . In just three short years, America has gone from energy dominance to energy supplicant. As a result, the American economy, the people of Ukraine, and the world geopolitical order are experiencing the deadly impacts of Biden’s anti-American energy policy.

The Biden administration repeatedly cites climate change to justify its decisions blocking new American oil projects and imposing punitive new restrictions on existing oil projects. Apparently, the administration naively believes Japan, India, and other nations will feel compelled to install industrial wind infrastructure as a result of reductions in U.S. oil production rather than simply purchase more oil from Russia and other suppliers.

Since taking office, Biden has blocked production in bountiful oil fields off the coast of Louisiana. The Biden administration has blocked oil production in lucrative oil fields in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, an area designated by Congress specifically for the production of oil. The Biden administration has ground to a halt lease sales on oil-rich federal lands throughout the Western U.S. To top it off, The Biden administration has imposed all sorts of new regulatory impediments on oil production that it cannot shut down.

We can see the results of these impediments when we look at the trajectory of American oil production under Biden versus the Trump administration. In December 2016, the month before Trump took office, U.S. oil production was at 8.8 million barrels per day. By December 2017, production jumped more than 10% to 9.9 million barrels per day. By December 2018, production rose to 11.9 million barrels per day. By December 2019, production rose to 12.9 million barrels per day. That’s a 47% increase in just three years. Production would have continued increasing if not for the global economic downturn caused by COVID. Yet even with COVID economic shutdowns, U.S. oil production was at 11.1 million barrels per day in December 2020.

Since Biden took office, COVID has receded, and U.S. oil production should be back surpassing pre-COVID numbers. That, however, has not been the case. U.S. oil production in 2021, post-COVID, was merely 11.6 million barrels per day. In December 2022, production was just 12.1 million barrels per day. U.S. oil production still remains well below pre-pandemic oil production under Trump.","April 14, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/biden-is-financing-putins-war-machine-with-his-anti-american-energy-policy/
Will They Ever Get Tired of Losing?,Greg E. Walcher,"The Detroit Lions have not won a playoff game since 1991 and have never been to the Super Bowl. But no defeat stops them from trying again and again. Just like the EPA.

A month ago in this space, we talked about a new round of litigation regarding the Administration’s latest attempt to control all water in the country, under the thoroughly discredited theory that the Clean Water Act gave EPA such broad authority. Lawsuits over the re-issued definition of “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) have been filed by 23 states, almost the same number as sued the Obama Administration over the same issue in 2015. Colorado led that fight, and won at the U.S. Supreme Court, because as the court ruled, the proposed definition goes beyond any power Congress ever gave EPA.

Two hints already show how this latest attempt will turn out, too. In the first judicial ruling on these new lawsuits, a federal judge in Texas delivered the first blow, agreeing that EPA’s WOTUS definition is “Destructive federal overreach.” He blocked the Biden administration from implementing EPA control over all water, for now in Texas and Idaho, the first two states in court.

The second major setback for the Administration came from Congress, where both Houses voted to overturn the EPA. The Democratic-controlled Senate passed the measure by a margin of ten votes, showing bipartisan opposition to EPA’s late-night re-issuance of the Obama rule (EPA quietly announced its final approval late on December 30). The President vetoed the bill, and the Senate’s margin is not enough to override the veto. But it nevertheless sent a signal, not only to the White House, but also to the courts, that Congress does not intend EPA to regulate every stream, creek, pond, and puddle in America. That was never the intent of the Clean Water Act, which applies specifically to navigable waters, and it still isn’t.

The judge blocked the rule only in the first two states, but the same outcome is almost certain in all the others. The Supreme Court already heard arguments in the case of the Sackett family, which EPA has harassed for over a decade for the unpardonable sin of wanting to build a house on their own property, which EPA claims is a regulated wetland under WOTUS (never mind that there is no wetland there, nor any navigable water). The Court already ruled against EPA on procedural issues and has now heard arguments in the case itself. Justices were very skeptical of EPA’s view during those arguments, and will eventually rule that EPA overstepped its authority.

No other ruling is possible if the Court addresses the underlying issue of whether EPA has this authority at all. That’s because the Clean Water Act of 1972, which empowers EPA to regulate water, contains the phrase “waters of the United States” in twelve places. Nine use the phrase “navigable waters of the United States.” (NWOTUS) and the other three refer specifically to the Gulf Inter-coastal Waterway. There are no non-navigable “waters of the United States” in the law.

These cases have attracted media attention for years, but most writers miss that central point. EPA and the White House say this is about “safeguarding our nation’s waters,” a classic misdirection. One recent writer said the WOTUS rule was issued “in an effort to curb water pollution.” Nothing about the Sackett case or hundreds of others like it has anything to do with pollution. This is about who gets to regulate. The constitutions of almost every state, and a huge body of federal laws, make it clear that inland intrastate waters belong to the states.

Another environmental reporter chalked it all up to changes in partisan power, writing that “The Trump administration had reversed the Obama-era rules, loosening federal protections on water sources, such as puddles and ditches, that it didn’t consider navigable waterways” (as if someone else might consider puddles and ditches navigable), completely ignoring the fact that federal courts had already blocked the rule. A CNN reporter tried to explain, “The Clean Water Act allows the EPA to regulate ‘waters of the United States,’ but the exact definition of such waters remains unclear.” Wrong again. The Act clearly defines waters of the U.S. as “navigable,” and despite several major amendments over the years, Congress has never changed that plain language.

In blocking the new rule, the federal judge in Texas also predicted the eventual outcome: “The States have already shown irreparable harm because they will expend unrecoverable resources – monetary and otherwise – complying with a rule unlikely to withstand judicial scrutiny.”

EPA will lose this battle again, but it will never give up this power grab. EPA is the government’s Detroit Lions.","April 12, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/will-they-ever-get-tired-of-losing/
Heavier EV’s Not Funding California Roadways,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","California has almost 400,000 miles of roadways used by the State’s 31 million vehicles. Those roadways are heavily dependent on road taxes from fuels that contribute more than $8.8 billion annually, the same gas tax revenues that also funds many environmental programs. That revenue source will be diminishing in the decades ahead as EV’s begin to replace internal combustion engine vehicles.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has mandated no sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles after 2035 but appears incapable of acknowledging EV’s currently contribute nothing for road maintenance and repairs and that EV’s are heavier than ICE vehicles and will be inflicting more wear and tear on California roadways.

Newsom’s silence on how California will finance the billions of dollars for the roads being used by those heavier EV’s is an indication that he will just pass that problem on to his predecessor. Newsom will not even discuss funding for future road maintenance as the EV mandate starts to negatively impact the revenue stream to maintain California roadways.

It’s public knowledge of Newsom’s dyslexia challenges that may hamper his ability to read reports that renewables and fossil fuels are not comparable for their support of humanity, but California voters support his avoidance of addressing those tough energy policy questions that would expose his limited energy literacy.

Regarding the high cost of energy in California, voters continue to be complacent with the state governments hidden taxes and mandates that contribute to the highest energy costs in America:

Fuels that are more than a dollar a gallon higher than the national average and

Electricity rates that are more than 60 percent higher than the national average and

Natural gas rates are more than 30 percent higher than the national average.

The California Governor may be experiencing a “dangerous delusion” of a global transition to “just electricity” that eliminates the use of the fossil fuels that made society achieve so much in a few centuries. From the proverb “you can’t have your cake and eat it too” tells us that:

you can’t rid the world of fossil fuels and continue to enjoy the products and fuels manufactured from fossil fuels.

Newsom may not be well read that there is little to compare between fossil fuels and renewables as fossil fuels are primarily used to manufacture products and fuels for humanity, while renewables manufacture nothing for humanity.

Fossil fuels make products for humanity that allowed the world to populate from 1 to 8 billion in 200 years .

. Renewables cannot manufacture anything for humanity! The current rhetoric is falsely transitioning from apples to oranges, as renewables and fossil fuels are different.

To add insult to injury, those so-called renewables of wind and solar are 100 percent made from the products manufactured from fossil fuels!

The above insult pales to my disappointment that our elite leaders are oblivious to the fact that fossil fuels made it possible for humanity to grow from 1 to 8 billion in 200 years, because they can be manufactured into thousands of usable, life-enhancing and life-saving products. On the other hand, renewables can only generate occasional electricity, but cannot manufacture anything for humanity, while fossil fuels manufacture everything for humanity.

By contrast, “transitioning” humanity to just electricity means converting to wind and solar systems that can manufacture none of the vital products now being used by humanity. That will very likely cause the death of BILLIONS of people from diseases, malnutrition, lowered living standards and weather-related disasters, whereas projections of millions of fatalities from “carbon emissions” and climate change are based on computer models that take none of these realities into account.

National economies and nations’ militaries still run on fossil fuels. As both World War I and II historians Russia and China know, the country that controls the minerals, crude oil, and natural gas, controls the world! They both know there is no substitute for fossil fuel product dominance in the foreseeable future, even on a longer-term horizon. To believe a transition to just electricity from renewables is possible from the products manufactured from fossil fuels and act accordingly is suicidal for humanity. As former Congressman Don Ritter of Pennsylvania wrote “It’s the real “existential threat.”

In any event, you cannot run households, businesses, hospitals, and the military on occasional electricity and no products from fossil fuels!

EV buyers beware that the “tax equalizer”, higher electrical rates and/or the “VMT” is coming. The Vehicle Mileage Tax (VMT) that has been discussed for years sounds like a logical idea – requiring the users of the highways to pay the fees to maintain those highways. The VMT tax will be needed to replace the $8.8 billion annually from fuel sales that will be diminishing in the decades ahead.","April 12, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/heavier-evs-not-funding-california-roadways/

New IPCC Report Suggests the Organization May Be Obsolete

Among the topics our Heartland Institute website Climate Realism has regularly addressed since it first came into existence a few years ago has been the publications produced by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We’ve evaluated the accuracy of its various reports, reported on the admitted weaknesses and flaws inherent in the climate models that inform the IPCC’s projections and policy recommendations, and recounted the regular misstatements the mainstream media and its chosen experts have made about what the IPCC reports say.

The IPCC recently released its final synthesis report in the Sixth Assessment Report series. The paper was focused on ginning up alarm and motivating policy, with no new science.

The mainstream media, with their marching orders in hand, regurgitated the reports’ topline talking points without any analysis or questions. Some of the headlines that led the news on March 20, the day the report was released, were, as we presented in a Climate Realism post, “World is on brink of catastrophic warming, U.N. climate change report says” (The Washington Post), “Now or never: One of the biggest climate reports ever shows time is running out” (NBC News), “Scientists deliver ‘final warning’ on climate crisis: act now or it’s too late” (The Guardian), and inarguably the worst of them: “New IPCC Report Shows the ‘Climate Time Bomb Is Ticking,’ Says UN Secretary General António Guterres” (Inside Climate News).

The main takeaway from the IPCC’s 85-page lament is that we are soon to surpass the dreaded 1.5℃ temperature rise which climate scolds claim will spell doom for the planet. At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 1.5℃ was pegged as the beginning of the end, with 2℃ being the point of no return.

Responding to the media hype surrounding the IPCC’s latest report, my Heartland Institute colleague Anthony Watts notes the IPCC and its boosters have made multiple climate doom predictions tied to lower temperature thresholds, all of which have been surpassed, with the repeatedly predicted doom never coming to pass. A reanalysis of Berkeley Earth global surface temperature data by Willis Eschenbach suggests that not only has the Earth passed the arbitrary 1.5°C threshold set by the IPCC, the planet has actually warmed by 4.0°C since 1750.

Whether the Earth has warmed 1.2, 1.5, or 4.0 degrees Celsius since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution matters less than the effect of the warming. Has it caused more deaths, worsening weather, and food insecurity, etc., as the IPCC’s new synthesis report claims (with high confidence)?

The answer to each of these questions is an emphatic NO!

Since 2016, Climate Realism has posted more than 270 articles refuting claims that various types of extreme weather have become more frequent or intense and showing that weather trends in general have not worsened during the period of modest warming.

In her response to the IPCC’s recent synthesis report, Robinson Center Research Fellow Linnea Lueken notes the report repeatedly makes testable claims that have been refuted by available data and are not even supported by the research cited in the IPCC’s AR6 Physical Science report, on which they are supposedly based.

The IPCC’s synthesis report so utterly botches the science and promotes unjustified alarm that University of Colorado, Boulder researcher Roger Pielke Jr., Ph.D., asks in a post, “Has the IPCC Outlived its Usefulness?”

“[T]he IPCC has strayed far from its role to assess the scientific literature in support of policy making,” writes Pielke. “It has increasingly taken on a stance of explicit political advocacy and as it does so it has ignored and even misrepresented relevant science. The IPCC needs a complete overhaul.”

Pielke cites specific failures in the IPCC Synthesis report:

[H]ere is the top-line conclusion of the past nine years of work under the umbrella of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: “Urgent climate action can secure a liveable future for all” That’s it. Generic and empty political exhortation that is all-so-common in climate advocacy. No science at all. What is a “liveable future” we might ask? Who knows? It is not a scientific term, and it is not even defined by the IPCC. The phrase appears in the IPCC AR6 Working Group 2 report and can also be found in the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degrees Celsius. It comes from a part of the academic literature that emphasizes “climate-resilient development.” The new report downplays research showing that extreme scenarios are increasingly implausible and once again centers research that emphasizes RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5. … Perhaps the most glaring omission by the report is on the science of “loss and damage” which is emphasized throughout the report. The Synthesis Report is not the only part of the IPCC that has ignored data and evidence on the economic and human cost of disasters, as I have frequently documented here. The IPCC makes a big deal about “loss and damage” as a central reason why action is needed: Economic impacts attributable to climate change are increasingly affecting peoples’ livelihoods and are causing economic and societal impacts across national boundaries. What does the data on “loss and damage” say? … Global disasters related to weather and climate have not increased. Their impacts on people affected, lives lost and damage as a proportion of GDP have all decreased (not shown here, but see this post for the data). [T]he overall number of weather and climate disasters have decreased so far this century, economic losses [are] down as a proportion of economic activity and deaths and people affected by extremes are sharply down in recent decades.

Although you wouldn’t know it from reading the synthesis report, deaths attributable to extreme weather and nonoptimal temperatures have fallen even more dramatically than property damages and monetary losses.

I go farther than Pielke in my critique of the IPCC. It has not suddenly become obsolete; it is and has been misguided and dangerous since its inception. The idea that some governments can by fiat decide at a single point in time to create an organization that “speaks for the science” of any particular discipline is misguided, unscientific, and dangerous.

Had the Earth’s modest, entirely conceptual, and in a real sense made-up “average temperature” rise never become a point of obsession for the IPCC; had the minor trace gas, carbon dioxide, the naturally occurring gas that is critical to all life on Earth, never been labeled a pollutant by the IPCC; had fossil fuel use never become the central villain in the IPCC’s climate crisis fairy tale, the world would be much better off today.

There would not be millions of young people around the world suffering from psychological disorders in response to the regular drumbeat of alarming coverage that has led them to believe they have no future because the world is coming to an end due to the rapacious actions of their evil forebears. We would not have squandered billions, if not trillions, of dollars in a vain attempt to control the weather by restricting fossil fuels and replacing them with environmentally damaging “green” energy alternatives. These wasted resources could have been devoted instead to raising the world’s poorest people out of poverty, building better infrastructure, providing reliable energy, increasing food supplies, and preventing and treating diseases. Certainly this would have done far more good for the Earth’s poor than the handwringing, haranguing, and development impediments thrown up in the fight to save the world from climate change.

Had the IPCC never been brought into existence, people would have more choices in the marketplace and in their personal lives, and in fact millions if not billions of tons of carbon dioxide would not have been released into the atmosphere by attendees of more than 30 years of grandiose meetings of conference of the parties, where global elites, their sycophants, and boosters fly in on private jets, take limousines and armored SUVs to four-star hotels, and eat elaborate meals in climate-controlled comfort, all to accomplish nothing that has had any effect at all on CO 2 emissions, concentrations, or global weather patterns.

What a waste of breath, time, and resources—except for those who have profited handsomely from it all. Climate change hysteria has fueled the greatest transfer of wealth from the poor in rich countries to the wealthy, corrupt, and powerful in rich and poor countries alike, in the history of mankind. The IPCC has nothing to recommend it, and in my opinion, it never has.

Old Refineries Incapable of Manufacturing Enough Light Hydrocarbons to Electrify The World,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The zero-emission movement in the wealthy countries are experiencing a “dangerous delusion” of a global transition to “just electricity” that eliminates the use of the three fossil fuels of crude oil, natural gas, and coal, that made society achieve so much in a few centuries. As old refineries accelerate their closure rates in the coming years, new Asia refineries are coming to the rescue! Does Asia’s rescue represent the good news or the bad news?

The future does not bode well as 20 percent of the 700 worldwide aging refineries are projected to close in the next 5 years that will result in less manufacturing with the loss of 140 sites to meet the ever growing demands of ships, jets, and the derivatives needed for all the products demanded by society. With less manufacturing in wealthy countries in the days ahead, further shortages and inflation of both fuels and products in perpetuity are guaranteed.

As old refinery closures accelerate, it’s becoming obvious that wind turbines, solar panels, and EV’s may face challenging growth as they are 100 percent made with those limited light end hydrocarbons that will diminish with refinery closures. But wait, Asia is coming to the rescue!

Asia is the region with the greatest number of future petroleum refineries. As of 2021, there were 88 new facilities in planning or under construction in Asia. The amount of oil fed through refineries in Asia has significantly increased in the past three decades as demand for petroleum products surged in developing countries such as China and India, both with significant less stringent environmental regulations than those in America. China is on track to succeed the United States as the country with the greatest oil refinery throughput.

These new Asian refineries, just like the mining in China, Africa, and Brazil for the exotic minerals and metals required for wealthy countries to achieve their net-zero emission goals, will be constructed and maintained on some of the LEAST environmentally controlled landscapes on this planet.

A subject for another time: Is the rescue by Asia’s new refining manufacturing capabilities exposing national security issues for America?

Today, oil refineries around the world are designed for specific crude oil feed-stocks available to those sites, and then manufacture a 42-gallon barrel of oil into light and heavy hydrocarbon products available from that feed-stock to support the world’s 8 billion on this planet are dependent on the 50,000 jets moving people and products, and more than 50,000 merchant ships for global trade flows, and the military’s of each country, and space programs that are based on the heavy hydrocarbons for the various fuels manufactured from crude oil. In addition, those light hydrocarbons are primarily used for making the more than 6,000 products now in society.

With enough money and technology, new refinery facilities could be designed to extract light hydrocarbons like ethylene from natural gas, and transportation fuels can be manufactured from coal, but both processes come with new equipment and produce excessive emissions.

No new refinery has been built in America since 1977, 46 years ago, so the need for new American refinery facilities to treat natural gas and/or coal may be a pipe dream to obtain environmental and construction permits for a new fossil fuel manufacturing site, when America is motivated to rid itself of both natural gas and coal, along with crude oil.

Today, about 90 percent of that 42-gallon barrel of crude oil is manufactured into the heavy hydrocarbon products like automotive gasoline’s, jet fuels, distillate fuel oils, diesel fuels, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and those “other products” which comprise the other 10 percent of a barrel of crude oil that contains light hydrocarbons, usually referred to as “oil derivatives” that are manufactured from crude oil.

Today, the big push is to reduce emissions, and the target is a future with net zero emissions. Here’s a very short scope of net zero (partial listing):

Electrify all cars, trucks, and train use. Electrify most heat uses, especially gas heat. Rebuild the grid so wind and solar generated electricity with battery storage are the primary electricity power source.

To achieve a world of only those light ends to make all the products now in society that supports lifestyles and all the infrastructures, there are thoughts among the green community that we can convert the existing old refineries to produce nothing but derivatives, and/or replace the existing refineries with derivative refineries, or just manufacturing those light ends. That may be another pipe dream as each refinery is designed for specific crude oil feed-stocks available to those sites, and conversions may be technically too expensive and not even permitted.

From the proverb: You can’t squeeze blood from a turnip:

A corn cob weighs in at about around 1 to 1.5 pounds per mature ear of corn. Fresh cut cobs yield around 6-7 ounces of corn. We can’t squeeze more kernels from a cob.

A 42-gallon barrel of oil contains about 90 percent of heavy hydrocarbons for various fuels, and about 10 percent of light hydrocarbons that are the basis of thousands of products made from those oil derivatives by -products. We can’t squeeze more light end hydrocarbons from a barrel of oil.

Such a switch of those old refineries to derivative refineries is a pipe-dream or an environmental and emissions disaster as 90 percent of that 42-gallon barrel of crude oil would need to be disposed of if not marketable as manufactured products like liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), automotive gasoline’s, jet fuels, distillate fuel oils, diesel fuels.

From the proverb “you can’t have your cake and eat it too” tells us that:

you can’t rid America of only the “fuels” manufactured from fossil fuels and continue to enjoy just the by-products of those light ends hydrocarbons that are manufactured from the same crude oil.

We may get to zero emissions, like we had in the pre-fossil fuel days in the 1800’s, but once we rid America of those fuels that generate emissions, manufactured at old refineries, we also rid America of the light ends that are the basis of the 6,000 products that did not exist before the 1900’s.

Just a few hundred years ago when the world’s population was around just one billion, before oil, the world was unspoiled, decarbonized, and dominated by mother nature and the wild animal kingdom. In the 1800’s there was no coal fired power plants, nor natural gas power plants, and the Beverly Hillbillies had not yet discovered oil. There were fewer humans competing with the animals due to humanity’s limited ability to survive what mother nature provided. Before oil, life was hard and dirty, with many weather and disease related deaths.

The ruling class, powerful elite, and the media lack some energy literacy which may be the reasons they avoid conversations about the ugly side of “green” mandates and subsidies. Before anyone in Washington decides to procure wind turbines, solar panels, or an EV, they should read the Pulitzer Prize nominated book that I co-authored, “ Clean Energy Exploitations ”, and decide for themselves if they wish to financially support the humanity atrocities and environmental degradation among folks in developing countries with yellow, brown, and black skin, so that the wealthy countries can go green.

Thus, without planned replacements in America for what is now manufactured from fossil fuels, we may get to the net-zero emissions society but with heavy reliance on Asia to achieve those lofty goals.","March 30, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/old-refineries-incapable-of-manufacturing-enough-light-hydrocarbons-to-electrify-the-world/
Still Not Good Enough,Greg E. Walcher,"When Vincent Van Gogh painted “Starry Night” in 1889, he did not consider it a masterpiece, certainly not the third most famous painting in world history, although Internet searches have given it that distinction (behind only DaVinci’s Mona Lisa and Last Supper). In fact, Van Gogh didn’t even think it was very good, as he confided in a letter to his brother Theo at the time. “The only things I consider a little good in it are… and the rest says nothing to me.”

My mother and aunt have been painting for many years. They both make exquisite pictures, then immediately criticize their work and find faults nobody else sees, such perfectionists they have become. It is a common trait among all craftsmen. It is not uniquely American but is certainly a common characteristic that we are a self-critical people, constantly fearing the worst, criticizing ourselves, worrying about the future, and almost never praising our accomplishments.

Think about America’s environmental successes. The record is not perfect, obviously, and much remains to be done. Acknowledging that reality requires no courage, because everyone already believes it. Yet it is also true that Americans have done more to clean up and improve their environment than any people who ever lived. That is especially true of the 50-year program to stop polluting the air.

Brown clouds in Denver, Los Angeles and many other cities were legendary when EPA developed the first air quality standards in 1970. Today the brown clouds are rare and intermittent, largely because of automobile improvements. Old cars were pollution machines, but science, engineering, regulation, and public demand brought cars that emit almost nothing. Electronic ignition, fuel injection, catalytic converters, and reformulated gasoline changed everything. The goal was to exhaust only carbon dioxide and water vapor, generally considered natural and harmless. Air quality improved dramatically. But rather than expressing pride in this astonishing achievement, environmental groups and federal regulators instead demanded regulation of carbon dioxide, shifting the objective to something other than clear air.

Sadly, the battle seems more important than the war, because the battle itself brings money and power. Even Aldo Leopold once said, “We shall never achieve harmony with land, any more than we shall achieve absolute justice or liberty for people. In these higher aspirations, the important thing is not to achieve but to strive.”

I admire Aldo Leopold, but the important thing, in fact, is to achieve. When we do so, we ought to be proud of it, look for ways to duplicate that success, and emulate those who achieved it. We don’t do that. We insist that it is not good enough.

Thus, the war against cars has never let up, despite the improved performance. Americans drive twelve times more miles than they did in 1970. Yet according to EPA, vehicle emissions went from almost 5 grams of the regulated pollutants (lead, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, and particulates) per mile, to almost zero by 2013. Today’s

new cars, SUVs, pickups, heavy trucks, and buses are almost 99 percent cleaner for those pollutants than vehicles made in 1970. Yet California, Colorado, and others are still moving to ban cars with internal combustion engines. Whatever the motivation, it is not about clean air.



Neither is the proposed ban on gas stoves and furnaces. At least 77 cities in 10 states have now banned gas appliances in new construction, despite the fact that natural gas also burns cleaner than ever before. American Gas Association figures show that emissions from natural gas distribution systems have dropped 69 percent since 1990.

Coal-powered electric generation is also far cleaner today. EPA air quality data demonstrates that modern coal plants, and older plants retrofitted with current technology, have dramatically lowered carbon emissions, while still providing 30 percent of America’s electricity. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fired plants declined 84 percent between 1990 and 2015. Yet the war on coal continues unabated.

So, if we switch cars, homes, and everything else to electric, where will that energy come from? The answer is fossil fuels, still the source of 60 percent of all electricity. Switching from gas cars to electric cars simply means switching the power source, from oil to coal and natural gas.

Be proud that we are still the world’s most mobile and prosperous people, while also breathing cleaner air. There is a place for self-criticism, but this isn’t it. The successful fight against air pollution should be studied, taught, and admired as the masterpiece it is.","March 29, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/still-not-good-enough-2/
Renewables and Fossil Fuels Are Not Comparable for Their Support of Humanity,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The reason for the growth in humanity from 1 to 8 billion in 200 years is simple: fossil fuels are abundant, cheap and efficient to provide reliable and dense energy at scale that can be manufactured into usable products by humanity. Renewables, on the other hand, cannot manufacture anything for humanity.

Fossil fuels have helped to generate a quality-of-life revolution for a portion of humanity, and people in poverty who have missed out on this blessing rightfully want what the people in the wealthy and developed countries already have.

Recently, Liberty Energy CEO Chris Wright explained in his viral video, dishonest terminology surrounds the climate debate. One of these terms is “Energy Transition”. The term’s use gives the impression that there exists a quick, easy, and scalable alternative to eliminate fossil fuel use without serious impact on humanity. The current rhetoric is falsely transitioning from apples to oranges, as they are different.

The current primary energy distribution by source, and forecasts by organizations like the EIA in their International Energy Outlook 2021, shows that this “energy transition” is non-existent. As you can see in the EIA graph above, and also in the 51-page Liberty’s ESG report on Bettering Human Lives, no present quantity of primary energy generated by oil or gas is currently replaced by renewables as they do different things. Fossil fuels are primarily used to manufacture products and fuels for humanity, while renewables manufacture nothing for humanity.

Again, the primary reasons that renewables are not replacing fossil fuels is that oil and gas are more heavily used to manufacture products, fuels, and fertilizers for humanity, while renewables can only generate electricity from breezes and sunshine. The obvious observation is that renewables cannot manufacture anything for humanity! Comparing renewables to fossil fuels is like comparing apples and oranges. They are different!

A couple of headlines from the Liberty report that you don’t hear discussion or conversations by the elite or the media:

Global primary use of products and fuels are about to grow by almost 50% between 2020 – 2050 as impoverished people rise from poverty that represent at least 80 percent of humanity , or more than six billion in this world are living on less than $10 a day.

, or more than six billion in this world are living on less than $10 a day. Oil consumption, the source for those manufactured products and fuels, rises in all U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) scenarios. Globally, liquid fuels consumption in the EIA forecast increases from an average of 99.4 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2022 to 100.9 million b/d in 2023. The higher consumption forecast is primarily driven by upward revisions to global economic growth.

increases from an average of 99.4 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2022 to 100.9 million b/d in 2023. The higher consumption forecast is primarily driven by upward revisions to global economic growth. Natural gas consumption, for heating and fertilizers, will continue to growth through 2050.

Sadly, few in the media report or even have discussions that there is almost nothing to compare between fossil fuels and renewables. To add insult to injury, those so-called renewables of wind and solar are 100 percent made from the products manufactured from fossil fuels!","March 28, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/renewables-and-fossil-fuels-are-not-comparable-for-their-support-of-humanity/
"PRESS RELEASE: Biden Energy Policies Cost U.S. Households More than $2,300 Since 2021","Linnea Lueken, James Taylor","Energy prices have continued to rise under President Joe Biden’s radical energy and climate agenda

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (March 24, 2023) – Energy prices have continued to rise under President Joe Biden’s radical energy and climate agenda according to analysis by The Heartland Institute, 39-year-old a free-market think tank.

The tip sheet was put together by President James Taylor and Research Fellow Linnea Lueken citing the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The analysis of that data shows that household electricity prices rose 8 percent in 2021, Biden’s first year in office, but accelerated even more in 2022. In fact, energy prices have now risen 17 percent since December 2020, the last month before Biden took office. All forms of energy are now more expensive, putting a strain on the budgets of families and businesses alike.

Some key findings about energy prices over the last two years:

Overall residential electricity prices increased by 17 percent

Industrial electricity prices rose 34 percent

Home heating oil prices increased by 88 percent

Oil prices rose 61 percent

Natural gas prices rose 51 percent

The price of gasoline rose by $1.15 per gallon, or 46 percent

The Heartland Institute research shows that compared to two years ago, the average driver in the United States now spends an extra $650 in higher gasoline costs, $780 more in annual natural gas costs, and $1,725 extra for home heating oil. When you add in how higher energy prices are baked into the costs of all goods and services, the average U.S. household is paying $2,300 more in higher direct energy costs. When you factor in how higher energy prices affect inflation, most Americans are feeling an even larger financial hit.

“American families are already struggling to keep up with inflation, but Joe Biden’s energy policies are making inflation much worse,” said Heartland Institute President James Taylor. “My question is this, is the average American family glad it was forced to spend an extra $2,300 these past two years to fight mythical climate change? And have we noticed any climate results from each family’s expensive involuntary investment?”

The Heartland report explains the Biden administration policies that have led to these huge spikes in energy prices:

Slow walking oil and gas leasing plans, missing legal deadlines by months

Threatening new windfall taxes on oil companies

Issuing the lowest number of energy production leases since the 1940s

Repeatedly canceling legally required oil and gas lease sales

Passing the first direct federal tax on methane emissions

Doubling rental fees on onshore leases

Increasing and introducing new fees associated with leasing

Increasing onshore royalty rates by about 36 percent

Reinstating the Hazardous Substance Superfund Financing Rate on crude oil and imported petroleum

“The Biden administration is dead set on virtue signaling and prioritizing climate change, but all it has accomplished so far is making Americans poorer,” said Heartland Institute Research Fellow Linnea Lueken. “Atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements have not declined. Everything in our economy depends on affordable electricity and fuel, including hardening our grid and homes against the impacts of extreme weather events, whether or not they are caused by any human-driven climate change.

“A dollar and fifteen cents extra per gallon might not seem like much to the Beltway elitists and green-pushing billionaires, but to the everyday American, it hurts,” she said. “‘Scranton Joe’ should know this, but maybe he just doesn’t care.”

Legalized Climate Grifting,Paul Driessen,"Grifters have long fascinated us. Operating outside accepted moral standards, they excel at persuading their “marks” to hand valuables over willingly. If they ever represented a “distinctly American ethos,” they’ve been supplanted by con artists seeking bank accounts for funds abandoned by Nigerian princes.

Their artful dodging is epitomized by Frank Abagnale daring the FBI to “catch me if you can,” Anna Delvey inventing Anna Sorokin, Redford and Newman masterminding their famous Sting, and dirty, rotten scoundrels like Steve Martin, Michael Caine and Glenn Headly.

However, they were all pikers compared to the billion-dollar stratagems being carried off by Climate Armageddon grifters like Bill Gates, Al Gore, Elon Musk and Biden Climate Envoy John Kerry.

Their long cons are not only unprecedented in size and complexity. They represent the greatest wealth transfer in history, from poor and middle class families to the wealthiest on Earth. Most important, the plundering has been legalized by laws, regulations, treaties and executive orders, often implemented at the behest of the schemers and their lobbyists.

(You have to wonder how Mark Twain would update his suggestion that “there is no distinctly native American criminal class except Congress.”)

They and their politician, activist, scientist, corporate and media allies profit mightily, but legally, if not unethically, from foundation grants, government payouts and subsidies, and taxpayer and consumer payments based on claims that Earth faces manmade climate cataclysms. That most of us are willingly giving money to mandated “renewable energy” schemes and other corrupt practices is questionable.

Microsoft co-founder Gates’ estimated 2022 post-divorce net worth of some $130 billion enables him to donate hundreds of millions to social, health, environmental and corporate media causes. That usually shields him from tough questions.

But BBC media editor Amol Rajan recently asked Mr. Gates to answer charges that he’s “a hypocrite,” for claiming to be “a climate change campaigner” while traveling the world on his luxurious private jets – often to confabs where global elites discuss how we commoners can enjoy simpler, fossil-fuel-free lives: what size our homes can be, how and how much we can heat them, what foods we can eat and how we can cook them, what cars we can drive, whether we can fly anywhere on vacation, what our kids will learn in school, and more.

Caught flatfooted, Gates defended his use of fuel-guzzling, carbon-spewing jetliners by claiming he purchases “carbon credits” to offset his profligate energy consumption. He also said he visits Africa and Asia to learn about farming and malaria, and spends billions on “climate innovations.”

Indeed, Gates’ book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The solutions we have and the breakthroughs we need” calls for replacing beef with synthetic meat. Cattle emit methane, a greenhouse gas (00.00019% of Earth’s atmosphere) – so people should eat fake meat processed from vegetable oil, veggies and insects.

You may say, That’s disgusting. But Mr. Gates will profit mightily if his “recommendation” is adopted. He’s a major investor in farmland and the imitation meat company Impossible Foods, as is Mr. Gore.

How cool! Wealthy elites can save the world and get richer at the same time!

Beyond Meat’s stock may be down more than 75% from its one-time high, but investors will likely bring in lots more cash via new “climate-saving” diktats, while consumers are left holding bags of rotting bug and lab-grown burgers.

Carbon offsets? In the real world they’re part of the problem, not the solution. They don’t help Main Street; they too help rich Climate Armageddon Club members become wealthier.

Gates Foundation grants could prevent extensive African misery, brain damage and death from malaria, by spotting disease outbreaks and eradicating Anopheles mosquito infestations – today. But it’s spending millions trying to engineer plasmodium-resistant mosquitoes, which may pay off a decade from now.

Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. continues pocketing billions selling and trading carbon credits. In fact, between 2015 and 2020, the company received $1.3 billion from selling credits to other companies – more than twice what it earned from automotive sales. Times sure have changed since manufacturing tycoons got rich selling products, instead of hawking climate indulgences.

Musk also loves flying in private jets. Last summer, he even took a 9-minute, 55-mile flight from San Francisco to San Jose, instead of driving a Tesla. Wags might say that goes well with the way he and others have made a science of lobbying government agencies to subsidize fire-prone electric cars.

It’s all to protect the environment, of course – which is why Gore, Gates, Musk and Kerry think they’re entitled to travel by private jet and limousine. We’re also supposed to ignore how their cars and lifestyles are based on metals extracted and processed with African child labor and lakes of toxic chemicals.

Since Al Gore left the vice president’s office, he’s hauled in some $330 million railing about “rain bombs” and “boiling oceans,” and shilling for government and corporate “investments” in “green energy” that’s also reliant on supply chains running through Africa and China.

Never forget this fundamental rule: Wind and sunshine are clean, renewable and sustainable. However, harnessing these unreliable, weather-dependent energy sources to power modern economies requires millions of tons of metals and minerals extracted from billions of tons of ores, mostly using dirty, polluting processes in countries that are conveniently out of sight and mind.

In short, nothing about “renewable energy” is clean, renewable, sustainable, fair or equitable.

Moreover, the “climate crisis” is based on computer models that predict hurricane, tornado, flood, drought, sea level rise and other disasters vastly greater than the world is actually experiencing. The models also ignore five great ice ages and interglacial periods, the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, the Anasazi and Mayan droughts, and other inconvenient climate truths.

Topping it off, China, Russia and India are burning cheap coal to industrialize, lift people out of poverty, and leave climate-obsessed Western nations in the economic and military dust. Even if the West went totally Net Zero, it wouldn’t reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases even one part per million.

The climate change movement’s deceptions and contradictions seem to have no bounds – and know no apparent limits to how much loot they can rake in by lobbying federal, state and local governments, banks and financial institutions; waging media warfare; and engaging in political science with similarly minded legislators and regulators who control climate and energy laws, mandates, grants and subsidies.

What about ESG, financial disclosure, SVB, Credit Suisse, fiduciary responsibility, and accountability?

How can the general public be so oblivious to all of this?

FTX founder and alleged fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried revealed the secret. He avoided media and regulator scrutiny by donating to influential media outlets, the way Bill Gates does. That garners favorable press and social media – which also ignore, cancel and deplatform critics and skeptics.

Fortunately, gutsy interrogators like Rajan are discovering and publicizing what most of the bought-and-paid-for “journalist classes” still won’t. This helps more people see behind the curtain and find the self-interest, self-dealing and pseudo-science that create the scary climate crisis monsters.

Climate Armageddon Club games are costing us trillions of dollars, in the name of saving people and planet. Hopefully, more real journalists, troves of Twitter emails (this time kudos to Mr. Musk!) and congressional investigations will save taxpayers and families from additional costly, destructive policies.","March 22, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/legalized-climate-grifting/

[Fill in the Blank Climate Crisis] Season Is Here

Climate realists should gird their loins in preparation for the pending onslaught of stories in the mainstream media proclaiming this or that seasonal weather event is being enhanced by anthropogenic climate change to some degree somehow or other.

For the past two decades, every year as winter wanes and spring springs, the media has engaged in its contemporary rite of spring: climate fear.

As long as there have been seasons—long before environmental Chicken Littles began proclaiming the end is near because of climate change—spring has meant the start of allergy season, long so-called because pollen from flowering plants creates allergic reactions among sufferers. Modest warming has contributed to a slight decrease in the average period of below-freezing temperatures and late-season plant-killing frost. This means plants start budding and flowering earlier. The allergy season begins earlier than in the past few decades..

In the past few years, therefore, every allergy season has been accompanied by myriad news stories claiming climate change is making the season longer and worse. If the allergy season is lasting longer, that counts as a deleterious effect of climate change. What the stories ignore, however, are the net benefits of the longer growing season: a general greening of the Earth and an increase in hunger-reducing crop production. News stories bemoan the fate of allergy sufferers while ignoring the bigger picture. The stories focus on a drawback of a greener world—worsening allergies—while ignoring the much greater benefits: more trees, shrubs, grasses, flowers, and food crops, all of which is good for pollinators, animals, and humans. Even allergy suffers, except perhaps the most curmudgeonly, would probably consider a few extra days of allergies a small price to pay for a greener world with more food and less hunger.

Spring also marks the commencement of maple tree tapping season by the maple syrup industry. In recent years, tapping season has been accompanied by claims that climate change is destroying maple syrup production. You won’t have real maple syrup for your pancakes and waffles because of climate change! Quick, stop using fossil fuels! The data is clear, however: as the Earth has modestly warmed, maple syrup production has continued to break records, and there is no evidence this trend will change.

Then we come to the big four: floods, hurricanes, drought, and wildfires.

Towns and cities have been located along rivers since civilization began. Rivers make natural travel corridors and trade routes. As a result, every year when spring rains come, ice breaks up, and snow begins to melt, towns and cities along rivers have flooded. Not every town on every river every year, but some towns on some rivers, somewhere each year experience flooding. In addition, modern development along rivers has made flooding more likely or more damaging when it occurs. This includes building in natural flood zones, failure to maintain levees, channelizing feeder streams and rivers, increasing the building of impervious surfaces, and wetlands removal.

To hear climate alarmists tell it, you’d think flooding was nonexistent or exceedingly rare before humans began burning fossil fuels. However, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found no increase in flooding nor evidence of changes in flood frequency or severity that it can attribute to anthropogenic climate change. This is true even though the IPCC says climate change has contributed to increased incidents of heavy precipitation. As the IPCC writes, “heavier rainfall does not always lead to greater flooding.”

What’s true of maple syrup and flooding is equally true of hurricanes, drought, and wildfires. Each of these types of weather event occurs seasonally. There is a “hurricane season,” typically June through November. Drought doesn’t really have a defined “season,” but it is more typical in May through September (especially in the western United States). “Wildfire season” typically is in the summer months and peaks in August. (Wildfires, though not technically weather events, are more common during droughts.) Each of these event types has occurred with such regularity throughout geologic and recorded history that people have commonly seen them as having seasons—which began long before purported catastrophic anthropogenic global warming became a talking point for political, entertainment, and media pundits.

If recent history is any guide, once hurricane season and wildfire season arrive and as lands become drier during the summer, the media will slam audiences with story after story claiming human fossil fuel use is making hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts more frequent, more severe, or both. Most of these stories will feature so-called “experts” attributing this or that hurricane or fire to climate change, generally based on computer models when they bother to offer any pretense of evidence.

When models and theories conflict with hard data, however, we should accept the facts and reject claims that are falsified by it, no matter how elegant the theory, how complex the model, or how prestigious the person making the claim. That is sound science, as opposed to political science.

As to hurricanes, drought, and wildfires, that means acknowledging the data consistently contradicts claims that climate change is making any of those seasonal occurrences worse. Data shows hurricanes aren’t becoming more frequent or more powerful, regardless of the handpicked experts’ claims. Data likewise shows neither drought nor wildfire numbers or severity are above their historical norms: long-term trends evident in the data simply don’t support claims that wildfires and droughts are more frequent or severe now than they have been throughout history.

So: when you see stories this year claiming climate change is causing an apocalypse of allergies, maple syrup disappearance, floods, hurricanes, drought, and wildfires, check the facts. It will make you feel better. The Heartland Institute provides the fully referenced data on these and other extreme weather trends at ClimateRealism.com and ClimateataGlance.com.

Heartland Institute President James Taylor on Tuesday, March 14 was a guest on Tony Katz Today on WIBC radio in Indianapolis to talk about President Biden’s announcement this week about drilling in Alaska. (See our press release on that.)

PRESS RELEASE: Heartland Institute Experts React to Biden’s Alaska Oil Drilling Decisions (Willow Project),"James Taylor, H. Sterling Burnett, Linnea Lueken","“Biden’s action is far more punitive and stifling of Alaskan energy production than any action taken by any previous president, including Barack Obama.”

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (March 14, 2023) – President Biden this week approved the ConocoPhillips Willow Project in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve. The project is expected to create up to 2,500 new jobs during construction and 300 permanent positions, and allow up to 180,000 barrels of oil to flow daily through the Trans-Alaska pipeline.

However, Biden’s Department of Interior also introduced regulations to block new leases on 2.8 million acres of the Arctic’s Beaufort Sea and 13 million acres within the National Petroleum Reserve. A Biden administration official told The New York Times that the new regulations are designed to create a “firewall” against new drilling.

The Willow Project was approved by the Trump administration in 2020, but a federal judge threw out the permits in August 2021 citing the concerns of environmentalists.

The following statements from energy and environment experts at The Heartland Institute – a free-market think tank – may be used for attribution.

To book a Heartland guest on your program, please contact Director of Communications Jim Lakely at [email protected] and 312/377-4000 or (cell) 312/731-9364.

“Biden’s action is far more punitive and stifling of Alaskan energy production than any action taken by any previous president, including Barack Obama. Even Obama never had the audacity to impose such far-reaching restrictions on oil production in the National Petroleum Reserve.

“Biden’s action is akin to a family going out to dinner only to return home to find a juvenile delinquent smashing their house’s windows with rocks. Caught in the act, and having already smashed four of the home’s 10 windows, the juvenile delinquent says, ‘See, I did you a favor – I graciously left six of your windows unbroken.’ And then, on his way out of the neighborhood, the delinquent smashes all the windows of three neighbors’ homes. For this, the neighborhood is supposed to be grateful?

“If the goal of the Biden administration is to destroy American energy production at all costs, Biden’s decision to gut the Willow Project was a resounding success. If, however, the goal of American energy policy is to protect the American and global energy markets from increasing Iranian, Venezuelan, Saudi Arabian, Russian, and Chinese dominance, Biden’s newest action is complete suicide.”

“Biden wants credit for advancing America’s energy security and reducing prices at the pump, for releasing a small area of the National Petroleum Reserve for production. He should get no praise. President Trump opened up a much larger area of the reserve, a reserve set aside by law specifically for energy production. Early in his administration, Biden reversed Trump’s actions, withdrawing the area for production.

“Now, he allows drilling on one small area and he wants credit for putting America’s energy needs first. Wrong! On top of that, almost simultaneously with the Willow decision, Biden bars production on millions of acres of land and offshore. Biden’s energy policy is one step forward, three steps back for the American people.”

“Every time Biden is forced to do something positive for American energy production, he and his agencies follow it up with a backhanded slap. Just a few short weeks ago, Biden was giving press releases about how oil companies are villains. None of this should be a surprise to anyone, and Biden certainly should not get one ounce of praise for the Willow project going forward.

“This administration’s explicit goal is to cripple American energy producers over time, while at the same time chastising them for daring to exist in the first place. The executive branch is totally captured by extremists who would rather have our oil come from dictators and countries with little in the way of environmental protection, than see American energy security thrive.”

Slavery and Child Labor at the Core of Elites’ Green Energy Obsession

The much touted green energy economy and the net zero goals it aims to obtain are built upon a dirty little secret: slavery, child labor, and environmental destruction. In this essay, I’ll only be discussing the first two.

I was a presenter at the 15th International Conference on Climate Change, on a panel titled “Green Energy And Exploitation.” My presentation pointed out that a large percentage of the rare earths and critical minerals required for modern electronics, in general, and green energy technologies, in particular, are produced and/or refined in countries where—if labor and environmental standards exist at all (and are enforced if they do)—the standards are far short of what is required in developed countries.

The mining, refining, manufacturing, and transportation of the huge amounts of rare earths and critical minerals is a dirty business. Yet, they are vital to the magnets used in wind turbines, the cables, and stations used to transform the electricity produced by turbines and solar panels, and transmit it to its final destination, and the battery back-up needed to maintain electric power supply and reliability from those intermittent sources.

The International Energy Agency notes that offshore wind requires more scarce minerals, rare earth elements, and other critical metals per kilowatt hour of energy produced than any other source of electric power generation, renewable and non-renewable alike. Onshore wind and solar are the next most critical-mineral-intensive sources.

The vast majority of these critical minerals and elements are mined abroad, and almost all the refining of them is done by China alone.

A single on-shore wind turbine requires up to three metric tons of copper and magnets. Much larger offshore wind turbines require even more copper and magnets composed of rare earth elements. Thousands of pounds of ore must be mined to produce a single pound of rare earths, much less the combination of rare earths required for the magnets used in wind turbines. That’s not to mention the metals and sheathing for the cables and transformers. In addition, between 200,000 and 1,500,000 pounds of earth must be mined and moved to produce the lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, and other metals and trace elements necessary to produce a battery pack for a single electric vehicle. Thus, billions of tons will have to be mined and refined to produce the thousands of batteries that will compose the large-scale battery facilities providing backup power when wind and solar facilities are offline.

The conditions under which many of these minerals are produced, from mine to finished product, are appalling. For example, cobalt is a necessary component of the green energy technologies Biden is pushing on an expedited time-scale. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is largest producer of the cobalt in the world, by far. A large percentage of the cobalt is mined under appalling working conditions at small mines. Child labor is not the exception but the norm there.

Which brings us to China. China is the largest single provider of most of the critical minerals and rare earths used around the globe, and is almost the only refiner of such products—which means minerals and rare earths mined elsewhere, often with Chinese funding, are shipped to China for processing into usable materials. Much of the mining and refining of materials in China is produced by forced or slave labor, often of persecuted religious minorities, like Falun Gong followers and Uighurs.

Because, on these points, every single picture does tell a thousand words of misery, and I had dozens of photographs to choose from that I can’t display here, I invite my readers to view the my slide show online.

To be clear, those pushing Net Zero goals, like Democrats in Congress, green energy elites profiting from government support in the form of mandates and subsidies, and the Biden administration, know child- and slave-labor are used to produce the minerals their green technologies demand. They claim to care about it, but their actions belie their words.

The U.S. State Department has acknowledged child labor is rife in the production of cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The State Department claims it has a memorandum of understanding with the DRC to reduce the practice of child labor, but that agreement doesn’t have the force of law. The United States wants the cobalt and other minerals produced in the DRC, and nearby regions where child labor is also a problem, in large quantities—Now! Indeed, the Biden administration is leaning more on Africa to counter China’s control over U.S. energy. As such, there is little doubt child labor will continue to be part of the foundation of the growing demand for the wind turbines, solar panels, and battery packs. Increasing the demand for cobalt will increase pressure on cobalt mines to produce more, meaning either more children will be put to work, or existing child laborers will be forced to work harder under dangerous conditions.

Concerning China, once again the Biden administration acknowledged the problem of slave labor, having signed the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2021. Still, the reality of today’s supply chain, combined with insufficient intelligence on the ground to track forced-labor manufacturing, and less still the raw materials, makes it almost a certainty the green energy transition—the massive build-out being pushed by the Biden administration—will be built with minerals, rare earth elements, and parts using Chinese slave labor.

One of my co-panelists, Vijay Jayaraj of the CO 2 Coalition, discussed the flip side of this problem, recently: the developed world’s attempt to suppress the development and use of fossil fuels in developing countries.

A prominent form of modern slavery is climate imperialism, or eco-colonialism, wherein restrictive energy policies conceived and promoted by politicians in Western economies are forced on some of the world’s poorest. Though branded as environmentally friendly, these outlandish policies deny economic growth to those who most need it in Africa’s poorest countries.

According to the World Bank, in 2019, over 41% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lived in extreme poverty. Poor households in Africa often lack access to necessities such as clean water, electricity, cooking fuel and health care. The region’s weak economy coupled with poor infrastructure impedes access to education and job opportunities, further exacerbating poverty.

The West’s war on fossil fuels, which is being promoted with draconian polices in developing countries, adds to the obstacles of overcoming this deprivation.

In economic terms, Western climate and energy demands and restrictions are imposing severe negative externalities on developing countries. In moral, terms, the West’s climate obsession is immorally condemning present generations of impoverished peoples and nations to continued penury and early death, to help much wealthier present and future generations of people in developed countries avoid the cost and inconvenience of adapting to future climate conditions.

American Suppression of Fossil Fuels Courts a National Security Disaster,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The capacity of a modern economy to produce food and products for its citizens, and weapons and fuels for its military to project power, are the undeniable twin pillars of global power. Both depend on reasonably priced and readily available products made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. In other words, American literally runs and fights on products from fossil fuels.

The renewables of wind and solar only generate occasional electricity, but manufacture nothing for society.

Take for example the medical industry that did not exist just a few hundred years ago, that is now maintaining the health and well-being of the 8 billion now on this planet. Today, as an exercise in energy literacy, try to identify something, anything, in your doctor’s office, or the hospital, or the pharmacy, which was not made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

President Biden has been campaigning for years for the elimination of fossil fuels. But ridding the world of oil, without a replacement in mind, would be immoral and evil, as extreme shortages of the products manufactured from fossil fuels will result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths. Shortages of fossil fuel products would necessitate lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s, and could be the greatest threat to the planet’s eight billion residents.

The ruling class in wealthy countries are not cognizant that the planet populated from 1 to 8 billion in less than two hundred years, and that population explosion began right after the discovery of oil. That growth in the population was not just based on crude oil by itself, as crude oil is useless until it can be manufactured into something useable. Today, through human ingenuity, we have more than 6,000 products currently benefiting society and fuels for the 50,000 jets moving people and products, and more than 50,000 merchant ships for global trade flows, and the military and space programs.

Sadly, the U.S. is killing fossil fuel transport pipelines, curtailing permitting of refineries and natural gas export facilities, suppressing oil and gas leasing and drilling and, worst of all, stifling longer-term investment in the industry. Driven by an all-encompassing determination to limit CO2 emissions, Europe, and now America, have declared war on fossil fuels. Meanwhile, Russia and China burn oil, gas and coal and emit greenhouse gases at levels that dwarf the West’s.

QUESTION: Today, how can the ruling class in the few wealthy countries of Germany, Australia, UK, Canada, and America, believe that all the infrastructures and products manufactured from crude oil, such as medical, electronics, communications, and the many transportation infrastructures such as airlines, merchant ships, automobiles, trucks, military, and the space programs, are not needed by future generations?

Ridding the world of fossil fuels would result in a reduction in each of the following, as they all exist because of the products manufactured from crude oil, that cannot be manufactured by either wind or solar.

The medications and medical equipment at pharmacies and hospitals.

The 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range merchant ships that are moving products throughout the world.

The 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range jets used by commercial airlines, private usage, and the military.

The tires for the billions of vehicles.

The asphalt for the millions of miles of roadways.

The number of cruise ships that now move twenty-five million passengers around the world.

The space program.

The communications systems, including cell phones, computers, iPhones, and iPads.

The water filtration systems.

The sanitation systems.

The fertilizers that come from natural gas to help feed billions.

The pesticides to control locusts and other pests.

The number of wind turbines and solar panels as they are all made with products from fossil fuels.

The world leaders are experiencing a “dangerous delusion” of a global transition to “just electricity” that eliminates the use of the fossil fuels that made society achieve so much in a few centuries. From the proverb “you can’t have your cake and eat it too” tells us that:

you can’t rid the world of fossil fuels and continue to enjoy the products and fuels manufactured from fossil fuels.

National economies and nations’ militaries still run on fossil fuels. There is no substitute for fossil fuel dominance, even on a longer-term horizon. To believe and act otherwise is suicidal. It’s the real “existential threat.”

You cannot run households, businesses, hospitals, and the military on occasional electricity!

By pursuing climate-driven elimination and suppression of fossil fuels, the United States and its Western allies are heading for national security/defense, global/geostrategic disasters. Economies and militaries run on fossil fuels and, more than any other nation, America’s military would be emasculated without fossil fuels. The climate change imperative gripping the West is self-imposed civilizational suicide.","March 9, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/american-suppression-of-fossil-fuels-courts-a-national-security-disaster/
Time to Bite the Bullet Again,Greg E. Walcher,"When we have to do something unpleasant, the common expression is “bite the bullet.” The phrase originated on Civil War battlefields when amputations often had to be done without anesthetics. To distract the patient from excruciating pain, he would be given a lead bullet to bite down on. Sticks or leather were common, too, but bullets were preferred because they were plentiful, and because lead’s malleability prevented breaking patients’ teeth.

Some medical experts might be suggesting we return to that 19th Century torture, by drastically reducing the modern use of anesthesia during many surgeries. Why would any educated person suggest such a thing, you might wonder? Apparently, the gases used in anesthesia contribute to climate change, a far greater threat to mankind than the pain of surgeries.

Dr. Mohamed Fayed, a senior anesthesiologist at Detroit’s Henry Ford Hospital, explained a new study on the matter to the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ annual conference in Orlando, Florida. “Global warming is affecting our daily life more and more, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has become crucial,” he said. He lectured, “As anesthesiologists, we can contribute significantly to this cause by making little changes in our daily practice — such as lowering the flow of anesthetic gas — without affecting patient care.” Of course, no patient who has undergone surgery without anesthetics was invited to speak about whether such a decision might “affect patient care.”

Few of us would have a guessed that anesthesia would be the next target of climate activists, but Dr. Fayed pointed out, citing a 2010 study, “One hour of surgical anesthesia is equivalent to driving as many as 470 miles” in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. We all know the evils of driving our cars nowadays, so it certainly must reassure surgery patients to know they’re helping save the planet with a bit of temporary pain.

Even in the Civil War, the whole bullet-biting practice was barbaric because anesthesia had been invented several years earlier. Chloroform was administered to Queen Victoria during the birth of her seventh child, Prince Leopold, in 1853, thus popularizing the practice in obstetrics throughout Europe. Nor was the concept new even then – opium had been used as an anesthetic for centuries. Ancient Babylonians used henbane and hemlock to relieve toothaches 4000 years ago; the Chinese had practiced acupuncture as early as the Shang Dynasty; and cannabis vapors were used in India by 600 BC. Fourteenth-century Inca shamans chewed coca leaves mixed with ashes and cocaine and then spit into the wounds of patients.

The more modern approach, though, began in the early 1800s with the discovery of substances like nitrous oxide, morphine, chloroform, and especially ether. Dr. Crawford Long successfully demonstrated the use of ether on a surgical patient in 1842 and became known as the first anesthesiologist. They put him on a postage stamp in 1940, so important was his contribution to the comfort of generations of patients.

By the mid-1950s safer anesthetics like halothane began to replace ether, which is highly flammable, and chloroform, which is high addictive. Today the most common formulas include propofol, ketamine, thiopental, methohexital, etomidate, and a few other unpronounceable substances. Apparently, they are great for patients, but bad for the planet.

An article about this new study was published on the American Society of Anesthesiologists website and created an immediate Internet feeding frenzy. The headline read, “Reducing anesthetics during surgery reduces greenhouse gases without affecting patient care, study shows.” Clearly the publicity was embarrassing to the Society, because the article was removed within 48 hours after being exposed by the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT). Several other medical news websites have also removed it.

Anesthesiologists’ entry into the global warming debate probably should not be a surprise. After all, Harvard Medical School already announced its intention to embed climate change into all aspects of the curriculum, and two years ago the American Cancer Society Journal bloviated about the “carbon footprint of cancer care.”

That article explained, “To date, no studies have estimated the carbon footprint of cancer care… The energy expenditure associated with operating cancer treatment facilities and medical devices, as well as the manufacturing, packaging, and shipment of devices and pharmaceuticals, contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions in cancer care.” If there have been no studies, then of course that entire statement is pure guesswork, or worse, an assertion motivated by a political agenda. As CFACT’s Marc Morano asked, if you needed cancer treatment, would you go to a cancer treatment center that worries about its carbon footprint, or one that worries about curing cancer?

The lead bullet metaphor is especially apt for the climate change debate. The conventional wisdom essentially holds that – no matter how much pain is inflicted on the economy by the war against reliable, affordable, and abundant energy sources – to save the planet we must all “bite the bullet” and pay whatever it costs.","March 8, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/time-to-bite-the-bullet-again/
Climate Change Weekly #463: Net Zero: Scientifically Unjustified and Deadly,H. Sterling Burnett,"YOU SHOULD SUBSCRIBE TO CLIMATE CHANGE WEEKLY.

IN THIS ISSUE:

Editor’s Note: Presentations and panels at The Heartland Institute’s recently concluded 15th International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC-15) discussed the dangers of the pursuit of “net zero.” Net zero policies are an attempt by ruling elites in governments, bureaucracies, international agencies, and global corporations to force people to reduce their CO2 emissions to as close to zero as possible, with any remaining emissions being reabsorbed from the atmosphere. In the real world, with present technologies, pursuing net zero requires a sharp, near-immediate reduction or full cessation of the use of fossil fuels. A presentation by Heartland Institute Trustee Steve Milloy argued “Net Zero Is Unachievable and Will Kill People,” as the title of his speech put it. On another panel, three presenters discussed “Why NetZero is Impossible: The Continuing Need and Value of Fossil Fuels.”

Although it is undoubtedly important to know whether net zero is achievable and what its relative costs and benefits are likely to be, one should first ask: Are goals or policies to obtain a net zero society necessary or scientifically justified to prevent catastrophic climate change? There is no question that reaching a net zero steady state will require greatly restricting peoples’ liberties, impose huge economic costs, and probably have deadly consequences, both foreseen and unanticipated. Therefore, before embarking on such a wrenching societal transformation, we should be pretty sure the planet needs saving from climate change. If the science does not show catastrophic climate change is on the way, governments must seek other justifications for forcing people to change their lives radically to reach net zero.

So, is net zero necessary? According to a recent paper produced by the CO2 Coalition, the answer to that question is not just no but hell, no! The paper was written by two prominent, multi-award-winning physicists, William Happer, Ph.D., professor emeritus at Princeton University, and Richard Lindzen, Ph.D., professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with geologist Gregory Wrightstone, executive director of the CO2 Coalition, each of whom presented on science and policy at ICCC-15.

The remainder of this essay provides a lightly edited excerpt from “Challenging ‘Net Zero’ with Science,” plus quotes from its authors about the paper’s findings.","March 8, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/climate-change-weekly-463-net-zero-scientifically-unjustified-and-deadly/
Childish Beliefs Drive Lethal Energy and Agricultural Agendas,Paul Driessen,"Many eco-activists (and too many legislators, regulators, judges and journalists) have trouble thinking beyond slogans. They apparently believe declaring ecological emergencies, repeating clever mantras, and issuing proclamations and mandates will create a fossil-fuel-free, organic farming utopia. In their dreams.

Since 1950, American farmers increased per-acre corn yields by an incredible 500% – and other crop yields by smaller but still amazing amounts, while using less land, water, fuel, fertilizers and pesticides. Their exports helped slash global hunger and malnutrition. Farmers in Brazil, India and other countries worldwide have likewise enjoyed record harvests in recent years. Their success has many “roots.”

Hybrid seeds combine valuable traits from different plants. Biotech seeds protect crops against insects and viruses and reduce water and pesticide demand. Nitrogen fertilizers (synthesized from natural gas) join phosphorus and potassium in supercharging soils. School and online programs offer libraries of agricultural success tools. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) further spurs plant growth.

Long-lasting herbicides control weeds that would otherwise steal moisture and nutrients from crops, while enabling farmers to utilize no-till farming that avoids breaking up soils, reduces erosion, further retains soil moisture and preserves vital soil organisms. Israeli-developed drip irrigation delivers water without the evaporation characteristic of other irrigation methods.

Modern high-tech tractors use GPS systems, sensors, cameras and other equipment to steer precise courses across fields, while constantly measuring soil composition, and injecting just the right kinds and amounts of fertilizers, herbicides and insecticides, along with seeds, to ensure optimal harvests.

Imagine the bounteous crops for humanity if all these technologies could spread across the globe.

Instead, this planet-saving, life-saving progress is under assault – by well-meaning or ideologically driven, ill-advised or ill-intended … but all well-funded … organizations that demand natural gas bans, “more Earth friendly” agriculture and a return to “traditional farming lifestyles.”

Their hatred of biotech crops is intense and well-documented, but they also despise hybrid seeds. They want modern herbicides and insecticides banned, in favor of “natural” alternatives that are often toxic to bees, animals and people; may actually be synthetic (eg, neurotoxic pyrethrins); and are rarely tested for residues on produce or long-term toxicity to humans. They demand “natural” fertilizers, which often provide a tiny fraction of nutrients that modern synthetic fertilizers do.

They want to teach only “traditional” (ie, subsistence) farming, especially in Africa. They prefer to call it “food sovereignty” – which they claim is the “right” to “culturally appropriate” food produced through “ecologically sound and sustainable methods,” in accord with AgroEcology policies. In other words, millions more people (ruling elites and their kids?) doing back-breaking stoop labor, dawn to dusk.

Tractors? Why not horses, oxen or human labor, they ask? At least get rid of gasoline and diesel tractors and trucks, in favor of electric models. Never mind that EV tractors and combines would require several tons of battery modules, and still wouldn’t be able to do a full day’s work without hours-long recharges.

They want oil and gas locked in the ground. “We don’t need petrochemical products, especially synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides.” Or tractor tires, paint, windows, GPS/computer housings, and more.

Have these illiterati looked at their own clothing, food, homes, offices or world? Synthetic fabrics, cosmetics, cell phone and computer housings, pharmaceuticals, tapes and adhesives, protective gear, eyeglasses, car bodies, detergents, wind turbine nacelle covers and blades, medical devices, car bodies – practically everything around them and in their lives exists because of oil, gas and petrochemicals.

But we can just use biofuels to replace feed stocks for products we really need, they proclaim. Right.

Banishing oil, gas, petrochemicals and internal-combustion engines would certainly mean no more ethanol as a gasoline additive. That would eliminate the need to grow corn on 36,000,000 acres (equivalent to Iowa), and that land could be used for food crops or wildlife habitat. Except it won’t be.

Organic farms have significantly lower crop yields per acre and require far more land than conventional agriculture. Worse, ending oil and gas production means tens of millions of acres would have to be planted with biofuel crops, to provide feed stocks for thousands of now-petrochemical products.

That means vastly more tractors or human labor – and more water, fertilizers and pesticides – to cultivate and harvest sugar and oilseed crops (and algae). And then all those simple biofuel molecules would have to be transformed into much more complex hydrocarbons to provide the necessary feed stocks. That would require even more energy, from even more wind turbines and solar panels – on top of doubling or tripling our existing electricity needs, to transform the U.S. and global economies to all-electric systems, and repeatedly recharge the grid-balancing and power backup batteries those systems would require.

Or perhaps Team Biden plans to simply import all those petrochemicals and/or products – as it seems to be planning with regard to wind turbines, solar panels, battery modules, transformers and other “green” energy equipment. America will not be able to produce any of it, because Team Biden and its allies oppose mining and drilling in the USA (even for raw materials essential for their utopian “renewable” energy transformation – and we won’t even have affordable, reliable electricity to operate factories.

How can these “best and brightest” decision-makers and advisors be so ignorant, inept and clueless – so unable to connect even two or three dots? They’re destroying our planet, habitats and wildlife, to “Save the Earth” from a computer-modeled “climate crisis” that President Biden absurdly insists is “a greater threat than nuclear war.”

They base critical policies that deeply affect lives and livelihoods everywhere on childish beliefs in Santa Claus and Harry Potter. They think we can banish today’s energy and agricultural resources and technologies – and amazing replacements will just be there … via some mystical, mythical process called Materials Acquisition for Government-mandated Infrastructure Change (MAGIC).

Some of them know this cannot possibly happen, but promote the policies anyway. They seem to believe they can mandate that “common folks” will just have to live austerely, under nineteenth or early twentieth century living standards, in 700-square-foot apartments, using electricity when it’s available (not when they need it), and subsisting on bug burgers and larvae milk.

They think Africa would be “the perfect laboratory” for testing new foods, like “crackers, muffins, meat loaves and sausages” made from lake flies. If all that fails, they’ll just impose forced rationing.

Others would go even further. Obama science advisor John Holdren advocated “de-development of the [United States and other over-developed countries] and semi-development of the under-developed countries, to approach a decent and ecologically sustainable standard of living for all in between.”

Oceanographer Jacques Cousteau once said, “in order to stabilize world populations, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day.” Environmental Defense scientist Charles Wurster said “People are the cause of all the problems…. We need to get rid of some of them, and [banning DDT] is as good a way as any.”

Environmental and racial justice? Campaigns, policies government actions to eradicate fossil fuels and modern agricultural practices and technologies go well beyond callous and imperious. They go well beyond eco-imperialism, eco-colonialism and eco-Apartheid. They drive eco-manslaughter on a global scale via energy, farming and climate policy. They impose systemic, systematic racism.

These ideas, and these policy proponents, are what should be banished from government, media and academic institutions. Not the wondrous technologies that make modern life possible.","March 2, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/childish-beliefs-drive-lethal-energy-and-agricultural-agendas/

Green Energy—The Greatest Wealth Transfer to the Rich in History,"Steve Goreham,","Originally published in Master Resource.

We are in the midst of history’s greatest wealth transfer. Government subsidized support for wind systems, solar arrays, and electric vehicles overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy members of society and rich nations. The poor and middle class pay for green energy programs with higher taxes and higher electricity and energy costs. Developing nations suffer environmental damage to deliver mined materials needed for renewables in rich nations.

Since 2000, the world has spent more than $5 trillion on green energy. More than 300,000 wind turbines have been erected, millions of solar arrays were installed, more than 25 million electric vehicles (EVs) have been sold, hundreds of thousands of acres of forest were cut down to produce biomass fuel, and about three percent of agricultural land is now used to produce biofuel for vehicles. The world spends about $1 trillion per year on green energy. Government subsidies run about $200 billion annually, with more than $1 trillion in subsidies spent over the last 20 years.

World leaders obsess over the need for a renewable energy transition to save the planet from human-caused global warming. Governments deliver an endless river of cash to promote adoption of green energy. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided $370 billion in subsidies and loans for renewables and EVs. But renewable subsidies and mandates overwhelmingly favor the rich members of society at the expense of the poor.

Wind systems receive production tax credits, property tax exemptions, and sometimes receive payments even when not generating electricity. Landowners receive as much as $8,000 per turbine each year from leases for wind systems on their land. Lease income can be quite high for a landowner with many turbines. In England, ordinary taxpayers pay hundreds of millions of pounds per year in taxes that are funneled as subsidies to wind companies and wealthy land owners.

In the US, 39 states currently have net metering laws. Net metering provides a credit for electricity generated by rooftop solar systems that is fed back into the grid. Solar generators typically get credits at the retail electricity rate, about 14 cents per kilowatt-hour. This is a subsidized rate, which is more than double the roughly five cents per kilowatt-hour earned by power plants. Apartment residents and homeowners that cannot afford to install rooftop solar pay higher electricity bills to subsidize homes that receive net metering credits. Rooftop solar owners also receive federal and state tax incentives, another wealth transfer from ordinary citizens.

US federal subsidies of up to $7,500 for each electric car purchased, along additional state subsidies, directly benefit EV buyers. The average price of an EV in the US last year was $66,000, which is out of reach for most drivers. A 2021 University of Chicago study found that California EV owners only drive 5,300 miles per year, less than half the mileage for a typical car. Most electric cars in the US are second cars for the rich.

A mid-size electric car needs a battery that weighs about a 1,000 pounds to provide acceptable driving range. Because of battery weight, EVs tend to be about 50 percent heavier than gasoline cars, which causes increased road damage. But EVs don’t pay the road tax included in the price of every gallon of gasoline. EVs should pay higher road taxes than traditional cars, but today this cost is borne by everyday gasoline car drivers.

Renewable systems require huge amounts of special metals. Electric car batteries need cobalt, nickel, and lithium to achieve high energy density and performance. Magnets in wind turbines require rare earth metals, such as neodymium and dysprosium. Large quantities of copper are essential for EV engines, batteries, wind and solar arrays, and electricity transmission systems to connect to remote wind and solar sites. According to the International Energy Agency, an EV requires about six times the special metals of a gasoline or diesel car. A wind array requires more than ten times the metals of a natural gas power plant on a delivered-electricity basis. The majority of these metals are mined in developing countries.

Almost 70 percent of cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Indonesia produces more than 30 percent of the world’s nickel. Chile produces 28 percent of the copper. China produces 60 percent of the rare earth metals. These nations struggle with serious air and water pollution from mining operations. Workers in mines also suffer from poor working conditions and the use of forced labor and child labor practices. But apparently no cost is too great so that rich people in developed nations can drive a Tesla.

To top it off, the European Union recently approved a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM will tax goods coming from poor nations which aren’t manufactured using low-carbon processes. CBAM revenues will be a great source of funds for Europe’s green energy programs that benefit the wealthy.

In January, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Washington proposed a wealth tax on billionaires. It’s interesting to note that all seven of these states mandate and heavily subsidize wind and solar arrays and electric vehicles, which transfer wealth from poor and middle-class residents to those same billionaires.","February 22, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/green-energy-the-greatest-wealth-transfer-to-the-rich-in-history/

Green Technologies Are Dangerous, Not Ready for Prime Time

I have written before about the known dangers green energy technologies pose to human health and life. In last week’s CCW I discussed a potential problem of which I was previously unaware: the micro-plastics/composite waste and chemical leaching of resins from wind turbines as they shred and chip over time.

In a previous CCW I discussed the hazards caused by lithium ion batteries, the motive force of electric vehicles (EVs), modern rechargeable electronics, and the battery farms used to provide electric power in some locations for some uses, usually as a backup to wind and solar power. The batteries overheat, catch fire, or explode far too often. This happens even when the batteries are not in use. It’s never convenient for your car, cell phone, or scooter to catch fire, but it’s even less convenient when something bursts into flames or explodes on a plane or in your garage and burns its surroundings down.

With the recent spate of articles discussing fires caused by EV batteries and atop wind turbines, it seems the mainstream media is only now catching on to what we at The Heartland Institute, the airlines, and actual green technology users have long reported: green tech can be dangerous.

For instance, a recent NBC News story reported on a July 2022 incident in which a transit bus in Connecticut spontaneously burst into flames while parked (I reported on it at the time) and an apartment fire sparked by an electric scooter which killed a five year old girl and a 36 year old woman, among other incidents. Lithium-ion batteries were identified by fire marshals as the cause of more than 200 fires in New York City in 2022 alone, killing six people and injuring nearly 150.

The problem is worse than that. It is not just that the batteries powering EVs randomly burst into flames. An additional problem is that they spew toxic fumes when they do, making them even harder to extinguish, even when fire departments are adequately equipped to do so, which many aren’t.

On this point, the NBC News reporters write,

“The source of the gasses that are creating the flames is confined within a cell battery that will not allow water in,” said Ofodike Ezekoye, a fire scientist and professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. “When firefighters are responding to these types of incidents, it takes a lot longer to be able to control the fire because it requires so much more water.” …

Hunter Clare and Justin Lopez, who work for the fire department in Peoria, Arizona, have firsthand experience of the hazards.

In April 2019, the two fire captains responded to a call at a facility that was housing thousands of lithium-ion batteries used to store energy for a power grid. The batteries are critical components in such facilities that store solar energy.

Clare and Lopez arrived along with other first responders to find a white cloud of vapor seeping out of the building and drifting across the desert.

“It was staying about 3 to 4 feet off the ground, and it was kind of swaying like sea water,” Clare said.

The firefighters suspected that it was some kind of chemical cocktail. They secured the area and used special devices to test the air, which showed dangerous levels of hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide.

Then they waited until the vapors stopped flowing out of the building and the levels of flammable gas dropped. Nearly two hours passed before the firefighters made their way to the front door of the facility. When they opened it, a large cloud escaped the building. Before they could retreat to safety, the space ignited, setting off a powerful explosion.

Coming to a location near you: dangerous fires allowed to burn for more than two hours, belching toxic gases and producing secondary explosions. Hope your local fire departments are prepared.

When EV batteries aren’t burning down homes, businesses, and apartment blocks or making people sick, wind turbines are exploding, collapsing, and burning, threating the lives of people hundreds of yards away from the source of a problem.

Whatever could I be talking about, you ask? Just this: wind turbines are self-destructing with ever-greater frequency. When the nacelles and blades aren’t exploding, tossing dangerous chunks of debris hundreds of yards in every direction—a hazard that has been recognized for some time and captured in numerous videos—they are catching fire or, more recently, simply collapsing, as turbine size and power have grown with limited time allotted for testing of structural integrity before deployment. The turbines were most likely tested using computer model simulations, and my readers know how reliable those are.

Some in the media are finally taking notice. IEEE Spectrum recently ran a story titled “Wind Farm Fires Far More Common Than Reported, Study Finds.” The writers reported on a study that found, “Fires in wind turbines are happening ten times more often than they are reported, according to new research from Imperial College London, the University of Edinburgh and SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden.”

As big wind companies Siemens and GE report multiple billions of dollars in losses in their wind energy divisions caused by unexpectedly high replacement and warranty costs, the news website HITC reports giant wind turbines are falling over at increasing rates. The report indicates newer, larger, more powerful but less-tested turbines are collapsing in unanticipated numbers all around the globe.

“The push to create larger and more powerful wind turbines has led to manufacturing challenges across the wind power industry, Bloomberg reports,” HITC notes.

It seems the old adage is true: the bigger they are, the harder (and more frequently) they fall.

It should go without saying, but I’ll say it anyway: large wind turbines exploding, catching fire, or collapsing under their own weight pose serious safety hazards to landowners, employees, passersby, and the general public in the vicinity of these industrial wind projects—which is a growing number of people because of President Joe Biden’s big push to build more wind, faster, everywhere.

Green hydrogen has a dark side as well, although it doesn’t get as much attention as wind facilities and EVs, being a much smaller though growing segment of the green energy marketplace. There has been limited coverage of the fact hydrogen fueling stations and the vehicles transporting hydrogen fuel have been exploding.

Fueling stations in Norway and California have both exploded in recent years. An explosion at a hydrogen fuel plant in Longview, North Carolina damaged homes and vehicles miles from the plant. An explosion in Norway caused air bags to deploy in cars on the nearest roads, sending at least two drivers to the hospital. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas, so it requires special handling and precautions in how it is transported, where it is stored, how vehicles are fueled, and its growing use for transportation.

To be fair, fossil fuel-powered vehicles and fueling stations and refineries can and do explode on occasion. However, many years and billions of dollars have gone into making them as safe as possible. The question now is whether we are spending enough time and money on testing and ensuring the safety of hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure and hydrogen vehicles, as we did for gasoline and diesel vehicles, or even as much as is being spent to force the rapid acceleration of the use of such technologies and vehicles as a means of fighting climate change.

Whether it is ever-bigger wind turbines, hydrogen fuel technologies, or increased use of EVs and battery power plants with provably combustible batteries, we have a moral duty to reduce the risks of premature or expanded and expedited deployment before undertaking a grand, dangerous experiment with the public. Any government should at least be open and honest about the potential dangers before pushing them on an unaware populace, to allow people to make informed choices.

Objective data reveal no evidence climate change is causing a crisis today. That means we have time to get the tech right. Regardless of whether that means better versions of existing so-called green energy technologies or entirely new, currently undiscovered energy sources, there is no pending climate apocalypse to justify the hasty deployment of energy technologies known to be unsafe, often for unexplained reasons.

Let’s not cause real deaths and destruction today to prevent phantom climate risks tomorrow.

Whale Hell Looms in Massachusetts,David Wojick,"The first of the monster offshore wind arrays is ready to roll, with construction to begin in May. The acoustic hammering on the whales and other sea critters will now escalate from sonar survey blasting to the incredible noise of pile driving. Each huge wind tower sets on an enormous monopile that has to be driven into the sea floor.

The project bears the happy name Vineyard Wind but there is no vineyard. Here is how they put it: “Vineyard Wind is currently building the nation’s first utility-scale offshore wind energy project over 15 miles off the coast of Massachusetts.” There are 62 enormous wind towers, each among the world’s biggest at 13 MW. See https://www.vineyardwind.com

For the incredible threat of pile driving noise see my https://www.cfact.org/2022/07/26/threat-to-endangered-whales-gets-louder/ Pile-driving noise can deafen, injure or even kill marine mammals. See for example https://www.arcticwwf.org/the-circle/stories/regulating-underwater-noise-during-pile-driving/ for a good discussion of the threat.

ndApparently this does not matter because Vineyard is federally authorized to injure hundreds of whales and thousands of other marine mammals, especially dolphins.

See Table 1 at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/action/incidental-take-authorization-vineyard-wind-1-llc-construction-vineyard-wind-offshore-wind for species specific take authorizations.

Here are the horrendous injury authorization numbers by group:

145 whales including 66 humpbacks and 20 right whales

6,040 dolphins

154 porpoises

851 seals

Of course these hellish damage limits are unenforceable, because the injuries occur out of sight underwater, but they show just how great the threat is. In fact they are merely estimates of the potential adverse effects.

The authorization numbers are derived basically as follows. First there is what is deemed a safe sound level. Using a sound propagation model they then estimate the area around the pile driving where the sound exceeds this safe level. They then use a species population density model over time to estimate the number of critters that will be exposed to unsafe sound. This number is used to derive an authorization number.

These are very crude estimates so the adverse impact numbers could easily be much greater. Population densities at a given place can vary greatly over time, for example.

From an engineering point of view the monopiles are amazing. Each is over 30 feet in diameter and several hundred feet long. They are driven so far and firmly into the sea floor that they hold a turbine-and-blades mounted tower hundreds of feet tall steady in major hurricane force winds (or that is the hope).

The pile driving forces have to be tremendous to get the piles that well imbedded, which is why there has to be so much impact noise. In this case the 13 MW turbines are much bigger than anything found in today’s big arrays around the world, where the biggest is just 9.5 MW. The forces involved should be at least that much bigger, so the driving noise might also be underestimated in the authorization numbers.

The potential damage to whales and other marine mammals is clearly huge, based on the official NOAA Fisheries impact authorization estimates. It is hard to see how this hell can be allowed under present laws, such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act.

Ironically the Vineyard Wind home page features a short video showing two whales swimming away. That come May these might be whales fleeing desperately, because they have been deafened by excruciating pile driving impact noise, seems not to have occurred to them.

The Math of Chaos: Why Weather and Climate Are Unpredictable,David Wojick,"That the weather is often unpredictable is well known. What may surprise you is that it will always be that way, especially long range weather, like a season or year ahead. And since climate is just average weather, it too will always be unpredictable. More on that later.

Before we look at why long range weather is perfectly unpredictable, let’s acknowledge that there are a lot of people selling long range weather and climate forecasts. They often disagree with one another, which is a strong hint that it can’t be done. Given a lot of different predictions, someone is likely to be right but that is like winning the lottery, pure luck. But there is no money in unpredictability, so the paid-for forecasts keep coming. Do not rely on them, because relying on a bad forecast is often worse than relying on none.

Now to the perfect unpredictability. It is a matter of math. Not that we are going to do any math, but I am going to describe what is says and why, in very nontechnical ways. In fact the math has a nontechnical name, which is “chaos”. Its technical name is “nonlinear dynamics” but we will not go into that.

Lots of things in the world fit the math of chaos and they are said to be chaotic. A rushing mountain stream is a good example. Throw something small into such a stream and it may go far before it stops, or hardly move at all, or something in between. Where it ends up is unpredictable. And so it is with weather. We live at the bottom of an ocean of air and that air is typically moving. Warm air is trying to rise, and cool, often creating clouds and rain or snow when it does. The cool air then tries to fall, often creating clear skies.

Here on the surface we experience sunny highs (high pressure) and stormy lows (low pressure). Highs are air falling while lows are air rising. In between we get wind as air also is forced to flow horizontally from low to high pressure. The result is a great deal of motion, made much more complex because it all happens on a spinning globe warmed by a single sun.

Predicting the weather means correctly saying what all this complexity will look like for some period of time, some time from now. Will next winter be cold or mild and how snowy? Will next summer be hot or not, wet or dry? How about next year, or just next month? The complexity makes forecasting difficult, but not impossible. After all we have giant computers to model the weather and satellites taking data, around the clock and around the world.

What makes prediction impossible is the math. Not that the math is difficult or complex, so it is not the doing of the math that makes long term prediction impossible. Rather it is what the math tells us. Let me explain. To begin with, imagine we are going to do a computer weather forecast. We first enter a lot of data describing what and where the weather is now. This is mostly stuff like temperatures, pressures, wind and precipitation. These are are called the “initial conditions”.

The computer then operates on these initial conditions to produce a forecast for the next day. Then it repeats the process, taking that day as the initial conditions to produce a forecast for the next day. This step by step process is repeated, going as far into the future as needed for the desired forecast. In some cases the step interval is longer than a day, especially if we are doing a long range climate forecast, which can go out hundreds of years. For simplicity let’s talk about six month forecasts. Suppose we do multiple runs, say with different initial conditions or on different computers, so getting different forecasts. This often happens, especially if the initial conditions are very different.

Now at last we get to chaos. The math says that under certain circumstances something very strange happens. It is called “extreme sensitivity to initial conditions”. What this means is that the slightest change to the initial conditions dramatically changes the forecast. This strangeness applies to weather forecasts. It might change a winter forecast from cold to mild, or vice versa. Same for wet versus dry, windy versus not so much, and so on for all the forecast features. Moreover these great differences show up quickly, in many cases in just a week or two, changing the entire forecast.

What makes it really bad is that these differences in initial conditions, that create very different forecasts, are so small they are undetectable. In the math they are called “infinitesimal” meaning infinitely small. In fact they are so small that we cannot tell what the real initial conditions actually are. That is, suppose we use a temperature somewhere of 53.6 degrees, but the actual value is 53.6000002. This tiny difference in initial conditions is enough to quickly throw our forecast way off. In fact an error if a millionth of a degree is enough to give us a very false forecast.

In short the only way to get an accurate forecast is to know things we cannot possibly know because they are too small to measure. Thus chaos makes even roughly accurate forecasting impossible. The technical term for this is “intrinsically unpredictable”. Beyond a week or two, weather is simply intrinsically unpredictable. Note that weather is still theoretically predictable, but you would have to know the exact initial conditions and this is impossible as a practical, real life matter.

Moreover, given that climate is defined as average weather, it too is intrinsically unpredictable. All the dire climate predictions we hear about are done by computers that either ignore chaos or keep it unrealistically small. We should not believe these forecasts. The future could be fine.

In summary, intrinsic unpredictability due to chaos makes accurate long range weather and climate forecasting impossible. Do not act on these forecasts.

Where Exactly Is This Property?,Greg E. Walcher,"“Cadastre” is an early 19th Century word describing a property inventory used to allocate taxes. The word has just found its way into federal law, thanks to an amendment added to the recent 4,155-page “omnibus” appropriations bill. The new section refers to an inventory of federal lands, which are not taxed at all, so technically it may be an inaccurate use of the word cadastre. But either way, the inventory is long overdue.

It is hard to imagine any property owner with no idea how much land he owns or where it is, but that is the U.S. government. Not even an educated guess has ever been produced, though Congress has asked for it, and presidents have ordered it. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has published several reports, all concluding that the government has no idea how much property it owns, where it is all located, who manages it, what condition it is in, or how it is used.

The government spends billions “managing” its properties. But it must be difficult, nay impossible, to manage property officials don’t know they have, or for which there is no government purpose, such as the land under the old RFK Stadium, or the dozens of D.C. city streets owned by the National Park Service, or thousands of buildings throughout America that are not occupied by any government agency.

At congressional hearings eighteen years ago, the Interior Department testified that it used over 100 different property management systems, and to this day there has been no consolidation. No department could testify to exactly how much property it owned, nor could the General Services Administration (GSA), officially the government’s property manager.

I’ve written about this before, noting that the lack of accurate inventories applies to real property (land and buildings), personal property (vehicles and equipment), and intellectual property (patents and copyrights). In all three cases, the federal government is the nation’s largest property owner, but cannot produce any complete list of what it owns. There is no way for GSA to make intelligent judgments on whether to dispose of surplus properties, or keep them, because it cannot even count them. A GAO study once estimated that there were 77,000 buildings the government no longer needed, but there was no process for identifying them precisely enough to sell them. Congress cannot make decisions about properties it doesn’t know about, which may explain why the bureaucracy has never really wanted to produce any inventory. After all, what self-respecting bureaucrat wants less stuff?

Now, for the first time, there is hope on that horizon. Legislation called the Federal Land Asset Inventory Reform (FLAIR) Act has been introduced every year since 2005, but this time it was tacked onto the Omnibus appropriations bill, the massive spending bill President Biden signed into law at the end of December. It is said that nothing good can come of 4,000-page bills because nobody knows what all is included, but in this case at least one good thing might come of it. It was in the bill’s “Division DD” addressing public land management, in “Title I” of the Interior Department’s annual appropriations, Sec. 103, which was on page 2,856.

The FLAIR Act mandates a current, accurate inventory of federal lands owned by the Interior Department, and by the U.S. Forest Service. For the first time, there is a section of law called “Cadastre of Federal Real Property.” Some say it was “buried” in the bill, but its advocates worked long and hard for years to convince key congressional leaders of its importance. My friend John Palatiello and his colleague J.B. Byrd, both with the federal firm of Miller Wenhold Capitol Strategies, spent years patiently shepherding the measure to this final enactment. It is an achievement of almost indescribable significance considering that the bill, for years unable to overcome the systemic laziness of the congressional process, was in the end approved by unanimous voice votes in both House and Senate committees.

It is exactly the way to begin solving this problem. The measure does not apply to thousands of government buildings and holdings of other types, or to other agencies. But it does apply to the government’s largest land management departments, which together own nearly 620 million acres and will now have to determine – and tell – exactly where it all is.

That may or may not properly be called a cadastre, since the federal government will never pay taxes on its property. But I have a perfect name for it – a really good start.","February 15, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/where-exactly-is-this-property/
PRESS RELEASE: Public Interest Groups Demand Federal Regulators Reject the Virginia Offshore Wind Project to Save the Right Whale,"H. Sterling Burnett, Jim Lakely","Dominion Energy hiding critical information concerning the project’s potential to destroy endangered North Atlantic right whale

Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Draft Environmental Impact Statement violates federal rules prohibiting human-caused killing of the right whale

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (February 14, 2023) – A coalition of public interest groups – The Heartland Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and the American Coalition for Ocean Protection (ACOP) – have filed comments with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), calling the Draft Environmental Impact Statement which BOEM has prepared for the Virginia Offshore Wind Project “woefully inadequate, fatally flawed, and absurdly indifferent” to the destruction of the North Atlantic right whale as a species.

Dominion Energy is seeking permission from BOEM to construct the largest offshore wind facility in the world. It would be comprised of 205 wind towers, each more than 800 feet tall – 1.5 times the size of the Washington Monument. It would span 112,00 acres – four times larger than New York City – located in the open ocean 27 miles off the coast of Virginia. The wind towers, plus 300 miles of trenched underwater cables, lie directly in the north/south migration path of the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, only about 350 of which remain in existence.

The National Marine Fisheries Service, the sister agency to BOEM, issued an opinion in 2022 stating that the North Atlantic right whale can only survive as a species if there are zero human-caused fatalities in any given calendar year. Even BOEM’s own evaluation of the Virginia Project concludes that its negative impact on the right whale species will be “major.”

“Not only does the DEIS admit that the project will continue to produce human-caused killing of the right whale,” said Craig Rucker, President of CFACT, “but Dominion Energy has chosen to hide from public inspection all of the critical information relating to the right whale contained in its Construction and Operations Plan (COP).

“Dominion Energy has declined to respond to our request to release this critical information,” Rucker said. “Without this information in the COP, the public is left in the dark as to how Dominion intends to comply with the zero-kill mandate required by BOEM.”

Appendix R of Dominion’s COP, “Discussion of Endangered Species,” forms a critical part of the discussion in the DEIS concerning protective measures for the right whale. On Jan. 20, 2023, CFACT sent a letter by registered mail to Dominion seeking the redacted information contained in Appendix R. The response from Dominion, which declined to provide the information and referred all such inquiries to BOEM, was received by CFACT on Jan. 26.

Numerous dead whales have washed up off the shores of New York, New Jersey and Virginia over the last several months. The dead whale problem has become so acute that three members of Congress – Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ), Chris Smith (R- NJ), Andy Harris (R-MD) – as well as the mayors of 12 New Jersey coastal cities, have called for the Biden administration to order cessation of the sonar mapping now being undertaken by offshore wind developers in preparation for later construction of hundreds of wind towers off the coast of states stretching from Massachusetts to Virginia.

Within the past year BOEM has issued a dozen Incidental Harassment Authorizations (IHAs) to contractors working with offshore wind developers. An IHA authorizes these contractors to “harass,” but not kill, marine mammal species, including the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, while engaging in sonar mapping of wind energy development sites.

“Without undertaking the research and analysis it promised to undertake to protect the right whale, and by rushing the DEIS into publication, BOEM is making a mockery of the environmental review process,” said H. Sterling Burnett, Ph.D., director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute. “The entire project should be scrapped and abandoned. The massive industrialization of the Atlantic offshore waters caused by the Virginia Project and other related offshore wind projects is fundamentally incompatible with the survival of the right whale.”

“BOEM continues the process of approving the construction of over 3,000 turbines off the east coast in an area the greater than the size of Connecticut in critical whale habitat and migration zones,” said David Stevenson, president of ACOP. “The agency admits they have inadequate data on operational noise that could drive whales out of the lease areas into surrounding major shipping channels. The whales feed near the surface, and vessel strikes are a major cause of mortality. BOEM needs to take a multi-year pause to answer this and many other uncertainties before approving these large industrial projects.”

Biden Admits He Has No Plans to Replace America’s Oil Infrastructure,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","President Joe Biden continues his pursuit of the generation of electricity from wind turbines and solar panels while simultaneously moving to rid the world of fossil fuels. He has a short memory of petrochemical products and human ingenuity being the reasons for the world populating from 1 to 8 billion in less than two hundred years. America now represents a mere 4 percent of the world’s population.

The world’s population explosion was not just based on the discovery of oil alone a couple of hundred years ago. We have learned that crude oil is useless unless it can be manufactured into something usable. The 8 billion now on this planet are dependent on the oil derivatives and fuels that are manufactured from crude oil.

Today, the societies and economies within the diverse 8 billion people, are now dependent on more than 6,000 products in their daily lives, as well as manufacturing the fuels for 50,000 jets moving people and products, and more than 50,000 merchant ships for global trade flows, and the military and space program.

Ridding the world of oil, without a replacement in mind, is immoral and evil, as extreme shortages will result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths, necessitating lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s, and could be the greatest threat to the planet’s eight billion residents.

President Biden should be advised of the old proverb “you can’t have your cake and eat it too” which tells us that you can’t rid the world of fossil fuels and continue to enjoy the products and fuels manufactured from fossil fuels.

Under Biden’s watch, nine refinery closures in America have occurred in the last several years, the same manufacturers that are providing the derivatives for products and fuels for transportation that are the basis of a thriving economy. Those closures have resulted in the United States losing nearly 1 million barrels per day of oil refining capacity, with more set to be shuttered in the next few years.

These are the refiners that have closed recently or cut capacity under Biden’s watch:

LyondellBasell, Houston, Texas: Capacity: 263,776 barrel-per-day (bpd) Phillips 66 Alliance, Belle Chasse, Louisiana: Capacity: 255,000 bpd Limetree Bay, St Croix, US Virgin Islands: Capacity: 210,000 bpd Shell Convent, St. James, Louisiana: Capacity: 240,000 bpd Marathon, Martinez, California: Capacity: 161,000 bpd Marathon, Gallup, New Mexico: Capacity: 27,000 bpd Phillips66, Rodeo, California Capacity: 120,200 bpd HollyFrontier, Cheyenne, Wyoming: Capacity: 52,000 bpd Calcasieu Refining, Lake Charles, Louisiana: Capacity: 135,500 bpd

The same time that Biden is diminishing the supply of manufactured products and fuels, he was emphatic during his State of the Union speech that products for the American economy would be “Made in America” and the “Supply chain begins in America” to support our growing economy. Logic and economics have proven that increased demands concurrent with reductions is supply, will be the catalyst to shortages and inflation in perpetuity.

Life without oil is NOT AS SIMPLE AS YOU MAY THINK as renewable energy is only intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine and NEITHER wind turbines, nor solar panels, can manufacture anything for society.

Climate will continue to be a challenge, like it has for billions of years, but now, we have 8 billion on this planet that we didn’t have a few centuries ago, that we need to maintain healthy and productive in the decades ahead. Depriving them of the products and fuels manufactured from fossil fuels, could be a much greater threat to mankind, than any climatic challenges facing humanity.

Restricting the supply of oil feedstock to be manufactured by refineries into usable products for society is not helpful in meeting the growing demands by society. Further, Biden seems oblivious to one in five oil refineries that are expected to cease operations over the next five years which may another 20 refinery closures in America,

President Biden’s plans to reduce emissions from manufacturing fossil fuels into usable products is a commendable objective, but he has no plans for the replacement of what is now manufactured from fossil fuels, which are supporting the 8 billion on this planet.

In addition to the refinery closures occurring under Biden’s watch, the future does not bode well for the 80 percent of the world’s 700 refineries that are located outside of America. Projections are that 20 percent of the 700 worldwide refineries are expected to close in the next 5 years. Further inflation and shortages in perpetuity are guaranteed, as refineries manufacture crude oil into the derivatives and fuels for the world’s 8 billion.

President Biden could enhance his energy literacy by viewing a short 1-minute video produced by Epoch Times TV about renewables that only generate electricity, but manufacture nothing for society. The video has already been viewed by more than 800,000 on social media at https://www.youtube.com/shorts/stf2YrznkZU.

Answering the Climate Inquisition

Editor’s Note: Heartland Senior Fellow Anthony Watts contributed to this essay.

Climate realists or skeptics like me are constantly beset by a variety of logical fallacies and malicious labels cast about by researchers, politicians, and members of the mainstream media who long ago abandoned loyalty to the scientific method in discussions of climate change. I will hereafter refer to such people as the Climate Inquisition (CI).

Instead of thinking critically, the CI repeats already disproven critiques of our position on climate change, questions our motives (rather than addressing our arguments), and calls us names, acting more like ignorant schoolchildren than educated adults with a modicum of civility. Having closed their minds to evidence and even the mere possibility that humans might not be causing a climate catastrophe, the CI not only refuses to debate or engage climate realists, they try to deny us the ability to speak on the topic.

Among the most-offensive labels the CI calls climate realists is the term “climate denier.”

Examples of the CI’s malfeasance and name-calling arrived in the form of articles recently published by Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Grist, both of which were widely republished.

In the AFP story, “Politics, cash, fame: what motivates climate change deniers,” Roland Lloyd Parry jumped proudly onto the ad hominem bandwagon, claiming climate skeptics are motivated purely by greed and fame.

Parry and the people he interviewed falsely asserted climate change realists are in the pocket of Big Oil and other corporations in quest of fame and fortune. These claims lack any basis in truth and in fact have been refuted repeatedly, which is why evidence of such a connection is rarely, if ever, provided.

Climate realists, such as The Heartland Institute and the other organization dedicated to the promotion of sound policy founded in solid science, receive a negligible amount of funding compared to the great mountain of money invested in doomsaying climate research and climate-related political causes. Most accusers are unable to look at themselves in a mirror and see that if anyone is being bought and paid for in the climate debate, it is they.

The major CI people Parry quoted in his article—John Cook and Stephan Lewandosky—have a long history of pulling slimy, unscrupulous shenanigans to smear climate realists.

Cook, a former cartoonist and now a postdoctoral research fellow with the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University, tried to sneak into a 2019 Washington, D.C. climate conference hosted by The Heartland Institute. Cook falsely claimed to be representing The Weather Channel. His ruse failed. When he was ejected, his film crew recorded the faux outrage he expressed at being rightly denied entrance to a venue he was not cleared or qualified to attend as a properly registered journalist.

The behavior of Lewandowsky, a professor of psychology at University of Bristol, in the enforcement of climate orthodoxy has been arguably been even more nefarious than Cook’s. Lewandowsky has abused his credentials as a professional psychologist by remotely “diagnosing” the motives of climate skeptics, asserting realists suffer from a variety of mental disorders without ever actually interviewing them or disclosing his own biases. That is a clear violation of the canons of the ethics of psychological practice.

Lewandowsky’s misbehavior was so egregious that science journals twice retracted papers he wrote on the psychology of climate realists. In one paper, Lewandowsky compared climate sceptics’ ideas to the false beliefs held by moon landing deniers. Other scientists responded with scathing reviews of Lewandowsky and his methods.

After Lewandowsky publicly suggested “threats” were the reason one journal withdrew his paper, rather than shoddy science, the journal took Lewandowsky to task for spreading misinformation.

Parry violated journalistic ethics by failing to interview any climate skeptics to get their thoughts on claims that money and fame drive their efforts. Parry’s story is nothing more than a litany of logical fallacies piled one on top of the other. Facts need not apply.

The Grist story, “Climate denial campaign goes retro with new textbook,” is only slightly less slipshod. It was written in response to The Heartland Institute’s mailing of 8,000 copies of our Climate at a Glance for Students and Teachers (CAAG) booklet to high school science teachers across the country. The book covers 30 climate topics often discussed in science classes, to be used as supplemental material to the standard curricula, providing data and peer-reviewed evidence demonstrating the Earth is not experiencing a climate crisis.

Grist maligned Heartland right out of the chute by labelling the mailing as part of a “climate denial campaign,” yet nowhere in the story does it identify any facts the book supposedly denies.

Grist did get one thing right: Heartland went retro. We stubbornly cling to the “retro” idea that testing, observation, debate, and intellectual exchange are hallmarks of scientific, and thus societal, progress. We embrace quaint, old-school ideas such as that facts matter and when data and theory conflict it is the theory that must be reconsidered, not the data. Sadly, the CI rejects these traditional hallmarks of scientific practice, replacing them with the postmodern perversion of science which places power, politics (in this case, enforced consensus), and climate model simulations in pride of place above data and evidence. For the CI, if enough of one’s colleagues disagree with certain findings, the research is ipso facto wrong.

The CAAG book readily acknowledges climate change is happening—nothing new there, as its authors always have done so. The authors also acknowledge humans are probably playing some role in the current iteration of climate change—again, no denial there. The only part of the CI-endorsed narrative the book disputes is the one that has the least scientific support: that current climate change poses an existential threat to human survival or is even a crisis. Instead of simply asserting no crisis is in the offing, moreover, the book provides hard data rebutting the CI’s claims.

As Wyoming’s Cowboy State Daily accurately notes in its discussion of the book and Grist’s article in response,

The textbook is raising alarm among those who want children taught that the planet is becoming uninhabitable as a result of climate change and that anyone who questions that position is denying that climate change is happening at all, says an author of the textbook.

The Grist article couldn’t find any actual inaccuracies or unscientific sources, but rather complained the textbook doesn’t point out more frightening information.

The article also claims the institute received “hundreds of thousands” of dollars from libertarian billionaires of the Koch family. According to the Heartland’s website, the Charles G. Koch Foundation made one donation to the institute in 2012 for $25,000 in support of free-market health care solutions.

Of course, to challenge factual claims made in CAAG, one must first describe the claims and present evidence why they are wrong. Grist never does this.

To the credit of the story’s author, Grist did interview me for the piece. However, the quotes they include from me are truncated and sharply limited in column inches compared to the lengthy, off-point quotes of the so-called experts the author interviewed criticizing the work. I’m afraid their bias was showing.

One of the most outrageous takeaways from the Grist story is the low regard in which the publication and its preferred experts apparently hold the nation’s science teachers. Grist quotes Glenn Branch, deputy director of the nonprofit National Center for Science Education, saying, “What Heartland is hoping for is to catch those who haven’t been equipped to understand climate science well enough to realize the highly misleading nature of the materials.”

Indeed, in interviewing me for the story, Grist asked me something to the effect of “How do you respond to claims that science teachers may not be equipped to understand the climate issue and its nuances well enough to weigh the claims made in CAAG?” That’s not an exact quote, but it conveys the idea. My initial response was if a teacher is unable to address the scientific issues of a topic they are teaching, they shouldn’t be teaching it. In contrast to Grist and Branch, we at The Heartland Institute believe science teachers and their students are fully capable of examining alternative arguments and doing simple online searches to check the data, especially because CAAG helpfully and transparently provides links to all the scientific sources for the points made in the book.

Sadly, the CI all too often tells anyone who might approach papers, articles, presentations, or statements by climate realists with an open mind that the science is too complex for them to understand, and that they should trust the experts when they say it’s settled and scientists have proven an anthropogenic climate crisis is in the offing, so the commoners should shut their ears and eyes, close their minds, and not bother to check the data.

Nothing could be further from the truth, and that is certainly not how science works. Hundreds of articles posted at Climate Realism and dozens of brief, informational “fact checks” posted at Climate at a Glance show the evidence—meaning measurable, recorded data—does not support claims that climate change is making the world less livable, causing more severe or more frequent bouts of extreme weather, or has caused an increase in weather- or temperature-related deaths. In fact, the long-term trend data shows just the opposite is true.

Rather than address the evidence and arguments climate realists present, participants in the CI deploy the tactics of dogmatists and authoritarians. When not just hurling names or using ad hominem attacks to discredit climate realists for daring to dispute “their truth” about climate change, they call for censorship, threaten careers, and even propose imprisonment for skeptics.

A quote from the great physicist Richard Feynman describes the CI’s limited grasp of the scientific method in general and climate science in particular, “The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.” It’s sad the climate inquisitors have so deluded themselves, and it’s unconscionable that they continue to try to fool other people.

In truth, if there are any climate deniers, it is the Climate Inquisition.

Washington Governor Jay Inslee Mandates an All-electric State,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","Washington State Governor Jay Inslee, like California’s Governor Newsom, is mandating his state toward an all-electric state. In doing so, Inslee is demonstrating his visionary limitations, as he cannot see the ugly side of his wind, solar, and EV mandated world.

For the vast acreage required for wind and solar, it’s pathetic destruction of pristine landscapes!

Further, after decades of working around the world, wind turbines and solar panels continue to have a live expectancy of about 20 years. To-date there is yet to be discovered a financially viable means of recycling those renewables. As a result, today’s old wind turbines and solar panels are being dumped into toxic waste dumps. Today, estimates are that by 2050, with current plans, the quantity of worn-out solar panels, much of its non-recyclable, will constitute double the tonnage of all today’s global plastic waste, along with over 3 million tons per year of unrecyclable materials from worn-out wind turbine blades.

Inslee could enhance his energy literacy by viewing a short 1-minute video produced by Epoch Times TV about renewables that only generate electricity, but manufacture nothing for society. The video has already been viewed by more than 800,000 on social media at https://www.youtube.com/shorts/stf2YrznkZU

Wind turbine blades are made of a tough but pliable mix of resin and fiberglass—similar to what spaceship parts are made from. Decommissioned blades are difficult and expensive to transport. They can be anywhere from 100 to 300 feet long and must be cut up on-site before getting trucked away on specialized equipment to a landfill that may not have the capacity for the blades. Landfills that do have the capacity may not have equipment large enough to crush them.

Solar panels are mostly made of glass, which has low value as a recycled material, but they also have small amounts of silicon, silver, and copper as well as heavy metals (cadmium, lead, etc.) that some governments classify as hazardous waste. Hazardous waste can only be transported at designated times and via select routes. Because solar panels are delicate and bulky, specialized labor is required to detach and remove them to avoid their shattering and polluting local areas.

Before committing to an all-electric State, Washington has the opportunity to seek decommissioning, restoration, and recycling down to the last dandelion of every wind turbine, solar panel, and EV battery, just like we have for a decommissioned mine, oil, or nuclear sites in America.

Inslee fails to comprehend “the nameplate farce” associated with his “green” renewables:

The problem with renewables is that they don’t work most of the time! There should be financial penalties for wind and solar power plants inability to deliver at least 90% of their permitted nameplate ratings on an ANNUAL basis, like their backup competitors of coal, natural gas, and nuclear power plants that provide continuous uninterruptable electricity. Subsidies and tax credits for wind and solar power plants are based on “nameplate ratings”, thus they should be penalized when they cannot deliver what they have been permitted for. Practically every windmill or solar panel requires a backup from coal, natural gas, pumped storage hydro, or nuclear, thus understanding electricity generation’s true cost is paramount to choosing and prioritizing our future electricity generating systems. The percentage of actual electricity generated by renewable sources compared to the nameplate capacity, is about 24 percent.

As a result of the intermittency of wind and solar generated electricity, Inslee is mandating that homes, businesses, hospitals, and the military run on occasional electricity!

Washington, like California, is also phasing out the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. WA like CA has yet to answer the question: Where are the buyers, outside the elite profile of existing EV owners?

The current EV ownership profiles of the oligarchic elite that are highly educated, highly compensated, multi-car families, with low mileage requirements for the families second car, are dramatically different from most vehicle owners that are single-car owners, not highly educated, nor highly compensated. Mandating a change to EV ownership and forced austerity may face a rebellion from those that need transportation.

The primary owners of EV’s are the highly educated, most with college degrees , and financially well off with average income of $150,000 , and not representative of the majority that are middle to low income folks, or those on fixed incomes.

are the highly educated, , and financially well off with , and not representative of the majority that are middle to low income folks, or those on fixed incomes. The EV owners represent multi-car families, the limited usage of the EV’s of about 5,000 miles per year is a reflection that the EV is a second vehicle, for those that can afford a second vehicle, and not the family workhorse vehicle .

Through his continuous support of subsidies and tax credits to go “green”, Washington Governor Inslee is providing financial incentives to the developing countries mining for those exotic minerals and metals to support the “green” movement to continue environmental degradation to their local landscapes, and impose humanity atrocities to citizens with yellow, brown, and black skinned workers being exploited for the green movement!

Inslee lacks some energy literacy which may be the reasons he avoids conversations about the ugly side of his “green” mandates. Before anyone in Washington decides to procure wind turbines, solar panels, or an EV, they should read the Pulitzer Prize nominated book “ Clean Energy Exploitations ”, and decide for themselves if they wish to financially support the environmental degradation and humanity atrocities among folks with yellow, brown, and black skin occurring in developing countries, so that the wealthy countries can go green.

Everything That Needs Electricity Is Made With Oil,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The few wealthy countries pursuing the generation of electricity from wind turbines and solar panels while simultaneously moving to rid the world of fossil fuels have short memories of petrochemical products and human ingenuity being the reasons for the world populating from 1 to 8 billion in less than two hundred years.

Renewables may be able to generate intermittent electricity form breezes and sunshine, but they cannot replace what is manufactured from fossil fuels, that are demanded by lifestyles and economies around the world.

Efforts to cease the use of crude oil will be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change, and lead the world to an era of guaranteed extreme shortages like we had in the decarbonized world in the 1800’s without fossil fuel products. This pursuit of renewables without fossil fuels can only lead us back to shorter life spans, diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths resulting from the elimination of the products from fossil fuels that are now benefiting society.

If the zero-emission cult succeeds in ridding the world of fossil fuels, wind turbines and solar panels may be able to generate intermittent electricity, but they cannot manufacture anything. Electricity from breezes and sunshine may be renewable, but it’s not reliable. Again, short memories about the zero-emission society that we already had in the 1800’s.

Everything that needs electricity is made with the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. Let’s take a look at a few infrastructures, and products, that did not exist before the 1800’s, that now need electricity to operate:

Transportation

Hospitals

Medical equipment

Appliances

Electronics

Telecommunications

Communications systems

Space programs

Heating and ventilating

Military

The challenge for the renewable movement is that refineries only exist economically to manufacture gasoline and diesel fuels for the global fleet of road vehicles in 2022 that numbered about 1.446 billion, that’s with a “B”.

Refineries are not economically viable JUST to manufacture bunker fuels for ships, aviation fuels for planes, and oil derivatives that are the basis of more than 6,000 products that are now demanded by societies and economies.

The future does not bode well as 20 percent of the 700 worldwide refineries are projected to close in the next 5 years of these aging infrastructures that will result in less manufacturing to meet growing demands of ships, jets, and the derivatives needed for all the products demanded by society. Further inflation and shortages in perpetuity are guaranteed.

From the proverb “you can’t have your cake and eat it too” tells us that you can’t rid the world of fossil fuels and continue to enjoy the products and fuels manufactured from fossil fuels.

Of the current huge global fleet of vehicles, only 12 million were electric vehicles (EV) in 2021. Thus, less than one percent of the worldwide road vehicle fleet were EVs, and more than 99-percent of the global fleet was “yet to be replaced”.

As the electronification of the vehicle fleet moves forward to diminish the 99-percent “yet to be replaced”, there will be insufficient refinery manufacturing to support the IMPORTANT demands of ships, jets, and the derivatives needed for all the products demanded by society.

Efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization , not climate change, and lead the world to an era of guaranteed extreme shortages of fossil fuel products, like we had in the decarbonized world in the 1800s, which may result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition and weather-related deaths trying to live without the more than 6,000 products currently benefiting society.

Today, we have the fuels for the 50,000 jets moving people and products, and more than 50,000 merchant ships for global trade flows, and the military and space program. We also have the manufactured fuels for the vehicle population dominated by truck registrations, and the military and space programs, which are needed to support the worldwide efforts to feed those eight billion on this earth.

Just a few hundred years ago, before oil, the world was unspoiled, decarbonized, and dominated by mother nature and the wild animal kingdom. There was no coal fired power plants, nor natural gas power plants, and the Beverly Hillbillies had not yet discovered oil. There were fewer humans competing with the animals due to humanity’s limited ability to survive what mother nature provided. Before oil, life was hard and dirty, with many weather and disease related deaths.

There are now eight billion of us, with most people living much longer and more prosperous lives than the one billion people who were around when fossil fuels use took off after the mid 1800’s. Moreover, the richer we are, the greener most parts of the planet become.

As a reminder, we had a net-zero emissions society in the 1800’s when there were no coal-fired power plants, no natural gas power plants, and no crude oil to be manufactured at refineries into usable products,

Thus, without a planned replacement for what is now manufactured from fossil fuels, we may get to the net-zero emissions society but with a few billion less people on this planet that will die from starvation, diseases, and weather-related fatalities.

Biden Offshoring Pollution, Environmental Injustice

In pursuit of President Joe Biden’s stated goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below the 2005 level by 2030, the White House has initiated efforts to build 30,000 megawatts of traditional offshore wind facilities (with structures attached to the ocean floor) in federal waters by 2030, plus 15,000 megawatts of floating industrial offshore wind power generation by 2035.

To meet those goals, Biden and company will have to approve building thousands of huge offshore turbines, towering up to 620 feet above the water, over thousands of square miles of ocean. The Biden administration is soliciting leases in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of Maine and off the coasts of New England, the mid-Atlantic states, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, and Oregon.

In an earlier CCW, I discussed the terrible threat the Biden administration’s grandiose and economically and environmentally unjustified offshore wind plans pose to the survival of endangered North Atlantic Right Whales.

The threat to whales is hardly the only problem with Biden’s plan, as proven by an analysis of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s (BOEM) draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project (CVOWP). The CVOWP EIS is so inadequate and incomplete that it can fairly be labeled arbitrary and capricious. That would open it, and any permits that flow from it, up to legal challenges. What’s true of the CVOWP EIS is probably equally true of those for the entire range of wind projects now in the planning, leasing, permitting, exploration, or construction phases along the U.S. east coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and California.

Among the myriad problems I have identified when examining the CVOWP draft EIS is its artificially constrained assessment of the project’s effects on air quality and environmental justice. In a highly controversial and legally contested move, the Obama administration set a new standard for environmental reviews by federal agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Interior Department. It began to lard up the traditional and legally required calculation of the domestic benefits and costs of proposed actions with purported benefits of proposed rules and executive actions to people in other countries. The Biden administration has not disavowed that decision, as it should, but has instead embraced it. For example, Biden touted the global impact of his decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline project and his push for rapid expansion of renewable energy and electric vehicle use in the United States.

If the administration believes it is legitimate to count benefits to public health, the environment, and the climate in other countries in its calculation of the benefits of U.S. executive agency actions, it should also include the short-term, long-term, cumulative, and permanent costs or likely negative consequences of its actions in its Environmental Impact Statements.

For every offshore wind project, this would require accounting for worldwide air quality effects of the mining, refining, manufacturing, and transporting of the huge amounts of rare earth elements and critical minerals vital to the manufacturing and functioning of the magnets used in offshore wind turbines, the cables and stations used to transmit and transform the electricity produced from turbine to final destination, and the massive battery backups to maintain the electric power supply and reliability undermined by the intermittent nature of offshore wind.

The International Energy Agency notes offshore wind requires more scarce minerals, rare earth elements, and other critical metals per kilowatt hour of energy produced than any other source of electric power generation, renewable or nonrenewable. The vast majority of these critical minerals and elements are mined abroad, and almost all the refining is done in China.

A single onshore wind turbine requires up to three metric tons of copper and magnets, composed in large part from rare earth elements difficult to mine and refine. Much-larger offshore wind turbines will require even more copper and magnets with rare earth elements. Thousands of pounds of ore must be mined to produce a single pound of these rare earth elements, and even more for the combination of rare earth elements required for the magnets used in wind turbines. Then there are the metals and sheathing for the cables and transformers. In addition, between 200,000 and 1.5 million pounds of earth must be mined and moved to produce the lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, and other metals and trace elements necessary to produce a battery pack for a single electric vehicle.

This means hundreds of billions of tons of these minerals will have to be mined and refined to produce the thousands of batteries that will compose the large-scale facilities used to back up and regulate the electricity produced by the Biden administration’s planned offshore wind projects.

In addition to the water-polluting toxic sludge produced during the refining process, mining produces dust, and the factories refining it emit air pollution. The fact that the air pollution occurs thousands of miles away in countries with few or no environmental protection laws and limited or nonexistent enforcement—certainly nothing comparable in stringency to those of the United States—should not exempt the BOEM from acknowledging the air pollution produced in building our offshore wind industrial facilities. These emissions, contrary to the BOEM’s claims based on its limited accounting, are likely to be major and negative, not minor, moderate, or beneficial.

The federal government requires fossil fuel-related energy and transportation infrastructure projects to account for all emissions from production to final use in the EISs required to justify new pipelines and other projects. It hardly seems reasonable for companies involved in offshore wind development not to be held to the same standard.

And since the vast majority of the emissions from activities devoted to discovering, acquiring, refining, producing finished products, and transporting the vast majority of the raw material and finished products used in assembled turbines will be produced far away, it is arbitrary and capricious for the BOEM to limit its accounting for air emissions to “the airshed within 25 miles (40 kilometers) of the Wind Farm Area (corresponding to the OCS permit area) and the airshed within 15.5 miles (25 kilometers) of onshore construction areas and ports that may be used for the Project.” Every offshore wind project considered by the BOEM will cause profound emissions far beyond the immediate area of construction and operation.

In all its regulations and EISs, the Biden administration is careful to highlight and account for the expected “environmental justice” effects of a proposed rule or project. The CVOWP EIS is no different in this regard, with the White House claiming the effects will be “negligible,” “minor,” or even “beneficial,” depending upon the alternative chosen. This position is untenable if one considers the broader, comprehensive environmental justice effects, cradle to grave, of the CVOWP and other offshore wind developments.

Congo is the largest producer of cobalt, which is necessary for technologies critical to Biden’s net-zero goals. Cobalt is an essential component of offshore wind turbines. Most cobalt in Congo is mined under appalling working conditions at small mines. Child labor is not the exception but the norm there. The Biden administration’s State Department has acknowledged child labor is rife in the production of cobalt. Increasing the demand for cobalt will raise the pressure on miners to produce, meaning more children will be put to work or current child laborers will be forced to work harder and longer hours under dangerous conditions. These facts hardly show concern for environmental justice.

In China, the source of most raw minerals and finished green energy products and most of the world’s mineral refining capacity, forced or slave labor is common. Much of this involves persecuted religious minorities such as the Falun Gong and Uighurs. The Biden administration has acknowledged this problem, signing the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2021 and blocking the importation of thousands of Chinese-made solar panels. Still, the reality of today’s supply chain, combined with insufficient intelligence on the ground to track forced labor in manufacturing and still less in the development of raw materials, it is likely every offshore wind turbine will be built using or containing minerals, rare earth elements, and parts produced through the exploitation of slave labor. The BOEM should consider this in its assessment of the environmental justice implications of every offshore wind project proposed. Failure to do so is arbitrary and capricious.

The U.S. government should not be offshoring its pollution when constructing offshore wind facilities, nor should it ignore the environmental justice considerations in the creation of their core components. If such concerns can be ignored in the BOEM’s EISs for the CVOWP project and others, Biden should not use them to limit oil and gas leasing, production, and transportation projects in the United States.

Even if reducing greenhouse gas emissions to prevent dangerous climate change were a worthwhile goal (which, of course, I doubt), constructing thousands of huge offshore wind turbines would be an environmentally destructive, unjust, and economically foolish way to go about it. Biden should not ignore the negative effects of his climate and energy policies on the global community.

If we are to believe Biden’s rhetoric, climate change is a global problem. Therefore, assessing the global effect of U.S. climate policies is not just justified but virtually required from the moral, political, environmental, and economic points of view.

Heartland Institute Ships Climate at a Glance Book to Thousands of Teachers Across America,"James Taylor, H. Sterling Burnett, Anthony Watts, Jim Lakely","Book intended to be “supplemental” to standard curricula and counter alarmist narrative with facts on the climate that reflect current data and research

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (February 2, 2022) – The Heartland Institute’s new book, Climate at a Glance for Teachers and Students: Facts on 30 Prominent Climate Topics, will be arriving in schools across the United States this week, giving more than 8,000 middle- and high-school science teachers the latest data and research on the climate.

The 80-page book covers 30 climate topics often discussed in science classes, as well as among the general public and media, and provides the data to show the earth is not experiencing a climate crisis. The book is designed to be easily utilized by teachers to integrate into their lesson plans with its breakdown into five sections: (1) The Atmosphere and Land, (2) The Sea and Ice, (3) Temperatures and Extreme Weather, (4) Humans and Animals, and (5) Scientific and Policy Controversies.

The data in the book – with footnotes in each chapter citing the sources – was compiled by authors Anthony Watts, senior fellow for environmental policy at The Heartland Institute who has worked as an on-air meteorologist since 1978; and James Taylor, president of The Heartland Institute who has been studying and communicating about climate and energy policy for Heartland for more than 20 years. The book was edited by H. Sterling Burnett, director of The Heartland Institute’s Arthur B. Robinson Center for Climate and Environmental Policy and managing editor of Environment & Climate News.

Download a free digital copy of the book here. All three climate experts will be presenting at The Heartland Institute’s 15th International Conference on Climate Change in Orlando, Florida, Feb 23-25.

For more information about this book distribution, or to interview the authors, please contact Vice President and Director of Communications Jim Lakely at [email protected] or call/text 312-731-9364.

“Teachers and students need a concise, scientifically compelling summary of the most frequently discussed climate change topics,” said Heartland Institute President James Taylor. “Climate at a Glance for Teachers and Students provides exactly that. Moreover, the summaries are the perfect format and length to be daily lessons or homework assignments.”

“The goal of this book is to present facts that are normally ignored or outright distorted by pundits and the mainstream media,” said Heartland Institute Senior Fellow Anthony Watts. “Realizing that the book would be attacked from the beginning, because it is counter to the ongoing climate narrative, every topic is factually referenced to government science agencies such as NOAA, and NASA, as well as peer-reviewed science publications. People reading these facts for the first time are likely to be shocked to discover that what they’ve been told was true, simply isn’t.”

“Concerning climate change, too many science classes have become laboratories of indoctrination, teaching students what to think about this important topic, rather than how to think about it and reason through it based on facts and using the scientific method,” said H. Sterling Burnett, Ph.D., director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute. “With this book, we are circumventing the normal channels of communication with students and teachers, which have been foreclosed to free debate about climate, and going directly to the source.

“Providing teachers with a concise, easily accessible, fact filled book about key climate topics – eschewing all rancor, ad hominem, and politics. Anyone who wants to understand the true state of climate science, based in government data and peer reviewed literature, rather than headlines and quickly thrown together white papers, should read Climate at a Glance,” he said.

Among the facts in this book that counter common and false alarmist narratives about the climate:

Crop Production, p. 6: As the climate modestly warms, global crop yields have set new records almost every year. That is due, in part, to longer growing seasons and greater concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Floods, p. 10: The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports it has “low confidence” in climate change is impacting flooding. The annual cost of flood damage in the United States (per GDP) has declined significantly over the last nearly 120 years.

Snowpack, p. 12: Average North American snowpack extent is virtually the same as it was in the late 1960s, when U.S. satellite measurements began. There has been only a modest decline in Eurasian snowpack in recent years.

Coral Reefs, p. 24: Corals thrive in warm water, not cold water, and recent warming has allowed corals to expand their range. The primary causes of coral bleaching are not “global warming,” but sediment and agricultural chemical run offs.

Ocean Acidification, p. 32: Ocean water is not overly acidic with the pH of surface ocean waters falling by merely 0.1 pH units since 1850 and is still well above the neutral pH number of 7.

Sea-Level Rise, p. 36: Global sea levels have risen more than 400 feet since the beginning of the current interglacial period, as it does between ice ages. NASA satellite instruments, with readings dating back to 1993, show global sea levels rising at a pace of just 1.2 inches per decade with no sign that pace is accelerating.

Hurricanes, p. 41: The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found no increase in the frequency or severity of hurricanes despite modest warming.

U.S. Heat Waves, p. 49: The all-time high temperature records set in most states occurred in the first half of the 20th century. The heat waves of recent decades have been far less severe and frequent than they were in the 1930s.

U.S. Wildfires, p. 54: Even in the recent worst wildfire seasons, those fires typically burned one-fifth to half as much land as the standard wildfire seasons in the early 20th century.

Climate Refugees, p. 58: Despite much fear-mongering, a majority of the islands from which climate activists predicted would produce “climate refugees” due to sea-level rise have actually seen their landmass increase in recent decades. The United Nations confirms casualties linked to climate-related natural disasters have declined this century.

Polar Bears, p. 69: Polar bear populations have increased dramatically in recent decades despite claims to the contrary made in the media and among climate activists. Polar bears have thrived in much warmer climates than we are experiencing today.

The Heartland Institute is a national free-market think tank founded in 1984 in Chicago and now located in Arlington Heights, Illinois. The Economist magazine called Heartland “the world’s most prominent think-tank promoting skepticism about man-made climate change.”

Heartland has organized 15 International Conferences on Climate Change and published the 3,000-page Climate Change Reconsidered series of volumes by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change.

Feds Push Ignorance Defense for Whale Killing by Offshore Wind Development,David Wojick,"The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the NOAA Fisheries agency have both put out what amount to “arguments from ignorance” claiming that offshore wind development has nothing to do with the recent whale deaths. “We know nothing about it so it must not be happening” is a ridiculous defense to the charge of offshore wind development causing the death of a lot of whales. But this is exactly what the Feds are now saying.

NOAA Fisheries is a scientific agency and their version is more scientific, which is important because this is really a scientific issue. Let us look at their arguments. They have a fairly long FAQ page on wind and whales here: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales

Here is their core argument: “At this point, there is no evidence to support speculation that noise resulting from wind development-related site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales. There are no specific links between recent large whale mortalities and currently ongoing surveys for offshore wind development.”

These two sentences present different aspects of the argument. Let’s take the second sentence first.

The concept of “specific links” is pretty vague. It has a narrow meaning that BOEM has asserted, namely sonar blasting killing whales on the spot. There is indeed no evidence that this has ever happened. This is not like land based wind, where you can count the dead eagles on the ground around the tower.

Instead, likely causes of death are indirect and death may occur relatively far away in space and time. These causes range from injury, such as bleeding and deafness, to fleeing or avoidance or other behavioral changes.

But ask this question about possible injury: “How many whales have been examined for injury after being sonar blasted?” The answer is none, because there is no way to examine wild whales for bleeding or deafness. Thus the fact that we know of no instances of injury in no way means there are no such injuries. Injury might actually be common.

There are however some very specific links between mortality and sonar survey blasting in the broader sense. First of all, the East Coast humpback whale mortality rate roughly tripled beginning in 2016, which is just when offshore wind surveying really geared up. I discuss this in my article here: https://www.cfact.org/2023/01/23/evidence-says-offshore-wind-development-is-killing-lots-of-whales/.

The recent humpback deaths look to be part of this long term trend. The NOAA FAQ suggests that this huge 2016 jump in mortality might be due to a big increase in humpback numbers. This conjecture is falsified by the fact that the dramatic die-off of the severely endangered North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW) also started in 2016.

Given no other apparent cause, the ongoing sonar blasting surveys are the likely link between offshore wind development and ongoing elevated whale mortality. Thus sentence two is false. There is a likely link.

Sentence one says there is no evidence that survey noise could potentially cause mortality. It is amusing that this claim is falsified by NOAA’s own activity. Since 2016 they have issued over 40 authorizations for survey noise to harass large numbers of whales. One authorization I looked at permitted harassment of over 100 right whales, whose entire population is estimated at just 340 critters.

Harassment is defined as potentially inducing a change in behavior and these changes can potentially cause mortality. Thus NOAA Fisheries has emphatically certified the potential for survey noise to cause mortality.

I first pointed out a simple case last year in an article titled “How to kill whales with offshore wind”. See https://www.cfact.org/2022/09/27/how-to-kill-whales-with-offshore-wind/ (which I sent to a lot of people at NOAH Fisheries).

The article is about operational noise but site survey noise is just as bad, perhaps much worse. The wind site described is in a low traffic area, as most likely are, with heavy coastal traffic passing nearby. To avoid the horrendous noise, the migrating whales are forced to go around the site, which puts them right into heavy traffic.

The potential for increased deaths is obvious, making sentence one deeply false.

In fact there seems to be a huge gap in the science being done at NOAH Fisheries. On one hand they do a lot on underwater acoustics, that is noise, in order to do these Harassment Authorizations.

As I understand it they first estimate the size and location of the area where the noise level will be above the safe level. Then they use a density model to estimate the number of critters that will be adversely affected and the authorization number is derived from that. This is in effect a forecast of the potential, forced behavior changes.

On the other hand they also do a lot of what is called “population dynamics”. This means looking at what it takes to sustain or grow a given critter population, be it whales, other marine mammals, various monitored fish species, or even sea turtles.

For example they recently lowered the allowed human kill rate for NARW from 0.9 kills per year to 0.7, reflecting the steadily declining population. This means we can safely cause the deaths of no more than 7 whales every 10 years. Killing 2 whales every 3 years also meets this standard as the average is 0.67 whales a year. NOAA estimates we are presently killing well over 2 NARW per year.

What NOAA Fisheries does not seem to be doing is looking at the potential adverse impact of the authorized wind site harassments on the monitored populations, especially whales. Instead they now seem to be claiming that there are no such potential impacts, which is clearly false.

It is precisely this kind of adverse population impact that needs to be assessed before any more Harassment Authorizations are issued by NOAH Fisheries.

What harassment driven behavior changes are to be expected? How might they lead to deaths, such as by injury, infection, ship collision or fishing gear entanglements, etc? In some cases, especially the NARW’s shrinking population, adverse impacts on fertility might also be important.

The basic scientific question is very simple: “What is the potential death rate from proposed authorized harassment?” Authorizing harassment of whales and other protected animals should be suspended until this question is answered.

"Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Who’s at Fault for California’s High Energy Costs?","Ronald Stein, P.E.","California Governor Newsom is emphatically finger pointing, scapegoating, and complaining that oil companies are making outlandish profits, but he may be out of touch with the elephant in the room, the mirror on the wall.

While the governor is doing everything he can to shut down oil production in one of America’s most oil-rich states, the governor is blindly pushing California energy policies ahead of our basic energy realities – leaving the state at the mercy of an unstable world for the vast majority of its energy supplies.

While the U.S. scrambles to protect its energy security, California oil production is down 25 percent under Newsom, costing the state and the country millions of barrels of badly needed supply that could help ease prices at the pump and protect against volatility.

Under Newsom’s watch in the last few years, two of California’s refineries have virtually shut down and are no longer manufacturing gasoline, aviation fuels, or any oil derivatives for all the products in our society. Those two, Phillips66 at Rodeo that represented 7 percent of petroleum production capacity, and Marathon at Martinez that represented about 6 percent of in-state capacity, are now only focusing on renewable diesel. Shuttered petroleum refinery capacity is gone for good.

More bad news on in-state refining capacity may occur under Newsom’s second term with the permanent closure of two more California refineries, the Chevron Refinery at Richmond and the PBF Refinery at Martinez. If the courts uphold the 2021 Bay Area Air Quality Management (BAAQMD) rule 6-5 for a further reduction in particulate emissions, both have stated that they will shut down before spending one billion dollars to retrofit their refineries to comply with further particulate emission reductions.

With refinery closures, a short West Coast gasoline market is the new normal. California gasoline demand is made up on in-state refinery gasoline production, movements from the Pacific Northwest, and imports from abroad. When gasoline production falls short, additional supply comes by tanker from around the globe, but it takes 5 to 6 weeks to get cargo into California from abroad.

Globally, excluding China, about 3 million barrels per day of refining capacity closed since January 2020. The future does not bode well as 20 percent of the 700 worldwide refineries are expected to close in the next 5 years. Further inflation and shortages in perpetuity are guaranteed, as refineries manufacture crude oil into the derivatives that account for more than 6,000 products for society, as well as manufacturing the fuels for 50,000 jets moving people and products, and more than 50,000 merchant ships for global trade flows, and the military and space program.

Gasoline imports were also lower than the previous year, caused by a near tripling of freight rates.

The cost of freight has skyrocketed, creating a barrier for imports and the reality that gasoline blending in Asian refineries were hard to find to meet the local and state regulations on the California oil industry.

A strong draw on inventories in California has led to record low inventory levels. As supplies dried up, retail prices went up. With shrinking refining capacity, operating refining costs have increased.

At the height of the pandemic, many experienced personnel retired and will not return to the refinery work force, resulting in continued problems with labor availability and productivity.

In the face of an already short supply cycle and a tight labor market, refiners pushed routine maintenance schedules until pandemic conditions eased, then Russia invaded Ukraine. To keep up with demand, refiners deferred maintenance through the summer of 2022. This led to a pileup of planned and unplanned outages in the fall of 2022. September 2022 saw five West Coast refineries down for maintenance.

The U.S. refining industry has been shaped by government regulation for the last 40 years. California refining industry has shrunk 18 percent from 1982 to 1992, and another 16 percent from 1993 to 2022.

California’s refining industry is unique in the U.S. because of state regulations. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has set more restrictive standards for gasoline and diesel that national standards. Surviving refiners retooled to produce the CARB specification, but these boutique fuels create barriers to entry for outside suppliers. Less visible to the public is the impact of the regional Air Districts which mandate significant capital expenditures in the refineries and distribution systems.

Due to expensive environmental mandates, including requirements for refiners to make specific gasoline blends only sold in California, refiners are reluctant to make long-term upgrade investments because state climate and air quality initiatives disincentivize petroleum production. Here are the California Climate and Air quality Initiatives:

Low Carbon Fuels Standard (LCFS)

Impact on refiners: Incentivizes renewable fuel production and disincentivizes petroleum product production

Result: Some refiners convert from petroleum to renewable fuel production leading to a short petroleum products market. LCFS compliance is an added cost to consumers.

Cap and Trade (C&T)

Impact on refiners: Incentivizes reduced emissions by requiring refiners to buy allowances to offset emissions above the declining cap.

Result: The application of C&T to gasoline and diesel is called Cap at the Rack (CAR). CAR is the calculated cost of C&T added to gasoline and diesel sold at the terminal. C&T compliance is an added cost to consumers.

South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) NOx Rule

Impact on refiners: Requires refiners and other fuels and chemicals facilities decrease NOx and CO emissions.

Result: Affected LA-area refineries will have to install pollution control equipment to reduce NOx with a cost estimated by AQMD of $2.3 to $2.9 billion. Cost of compliance may be passed on to consumers.

Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Particulate Emissions Rule

Impact on refiners: Requires decreased allowed PM10emissions from refinery Fluid Catalytic Cracking Units (FCCUs).

Result: Affected Northern CA refineries, Chevron Richmond and PBF Martinez will have to install wet gas scrubbers to reduce FCCU PM10with estimated costs between $240M -$1.48B. Both companies are currently suing BAAQMD over the rule. Cost of compliance may be passed on to consumers.

California regulations have increased the cost of petroleum fuels and contributed to the decline in the refining industry in the state.

California has twice as many drivers per gas station than the rest of the country. There are several reasons that California has a shortage of gas stations. Real estate is expensive and often has a higher and better use that a gas station. Permitting in California is more difficult that other states.

Price spikes occur around unplanned refinery maintenance and are more dramatic than in the rest of the country because of the isolation from alternative supplies. Not discussed in this “mirror mirror” exercise, are the components of the higher fuel prices that include California’s higher excise, sales, and local taxes, plus the greenhouse gas fees that other states don’t have.

The elephant in the room that Governor Newsom does not see is the mirror that illustrates all the self-inflicted causes for the states’ exorbitant fuel costs.","January 25, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/mirror-mirrow-on-the-wall-whos-at-fault-for-californias-high-energy-costs/
Evidence Says Offshore Wind Development Is Killing Lots of Whales,David Wojick,"The recent deaths of seven whales off New Jersey, mostly humpbacks, got a lot of attention. The federal NOAA Fisheries agency is responsible for whales. An outrageous statement by their spokesperson got me to do some research on humpback whale deaths.

The results are appalling. The evidence seems clear that offshore wind development is killing whales by the hundreds.

Here is the statement as reported in the press:

“NOAA said it has been studying what it calls “unusual mortality events” involving 174 humpback whales along the East Coast since January 2016. Agency spokesperson Lauren Gaches said that period pre-dates offshore wind preparation activities in the region.” Gaches is NOAA Fisheries press chief.

The “unusual mortality” data is astounding. Basically the humpback death rate roughly tripled starting in 2016 and continued high thereafter. You can see it here.

But the claim that this huge jump in mortality predates offshore wind preparation activities is wildly false. In fact it coincides with the large scale onset of these activities. This strong correlation is strong evidence of causation, especially since no other possible cause has appeared.

To begin with, offshore lease sales really geared up 2015-16, with nine big sales off New Jersey, New York, Delaware and Massachusetts. These sales must have generated a lot of activity, likely including potentially damaging sonar.

In fact 2016 also saw the beginning of what are called geotechnical and site characterization surveys. These surveys are actually licensed by NOAA Fisheries, under what are called Incidental Harassment Authorizations or IHA’s.

There is some seriously misleading jargon here. IHA’s are incidental to some other activity, in this case offshore wind development. They are not incidental to the whales. In fact the term “harassment” specifically includes injuring the whales. That is called “level A harassment”.

To date NOAA has issued an astounding 46 one-year IHA’s for offshore wind sites. Site characterization typically includes the protracted use of what I call “machine gun sonar”. This shipboard device emits an incredibly loud noise several times a second, often for hours at a time, as the ship slowly maps the sea floor.

Mapping often takes many days to complete. A blaster can log hundreds of miles surveying a 10-by-10 mile site. Each IHA is typically for an entire year.

Here is a list of the IHA’s issued to date and those applied for.

There are lots of ways this sonar blasting might cause whales to die. Simply fleeing the incredible noise could cause ship strikes or fish gear entanglements, the two leading causes of whale deaths. Of the whales could be deafened, increasing their chances of being struck by a ship later on. Direct bleeding injury, like getting their ears damaged, is another known risk, possibly leading to death from infection. So there can be a big time difference between blasting and death.

Note also that these deaths need not be in the immediate vicinity of the sonar blasting, so spatial correlation is unlikely. Humpbacks in particular are prodigious travelers. One group was tracked traveling 3,000 miles in just 28 days, over 100 miles a day on average. Another group routinely migrates 5,000 miles. Both are winter-summer migrations which can happen twice a year.

Thus a sonar blasting, site characterization in one place could easily lead to multiple whale deaths hundreds of miles away. If one of these blasters suddenly goes off near a group of whales they might go off in different directions, then slowly die.

The point is that the huge 2016 jump in annual humpback mortality coincides with the huge jump in NOAA Incidental Harassment Authorizations. It is that simple and surely NOAA Fisheries knows this.

Nor is this just about humpbacks. Some of the dead whales off New Jersey are endangered sperm whales. And of course there are the severely endangered North Atlantic Right Whales, on the verge of extinction.

Even worse, the IHA’s are about to make a much bigger jump. There are eleven pending IHA applications and eight of these are for actually constructing 8 different monster wind “farms”.

Driving the hundreds of enormous monopiles that hold up the turbine towers and blades will be far louder than the sonic blasters approved to date, especially with eight sites going at once. These construction sites range from Virginia to Massachusetts, with a concentration off New Jersey and New York.

For more on this noise this previous piece by me.

Jay Lehr, R.I.P.

Last Thursday I received and unexpected call from Jim Lakely, vice president of The Heartland Institute, informing me that Jay Lehr, longtime Heartland Institute science director, had passed away. I was taken aback at the unwelcome news, unable to speak for a moment. Many of us, myself included, are still recovering from the news. As noted in last week’s CCW, Jay’s work and friendship touched many lives, so this week’s edition is devoted to remembrances of him. Separate remembrances from several of Jay’s colleagues and friends follows my comments.

Jay Lehr, 86, of Ostrander, Ohio passed away Tuesday, January 10, 2023, at Grady Memorial Hospital. Born September 11, 1936, in Bayonne, New Jersey, he was the son of the late Martin Moses and Rebecca (Dreznick) Lehr. On July 7, 1991, he married Janet Kingery at the Wyman Woods Park and they shared 31 wonderful years together.

Jay was an internationally renowned speaker, scientist, and author who testified before Congress on dozens of occasions on environmental issues and consulted with nearly every agency of the national government, as well as many foreign countries.

Jay was a leading authority on groundwater hydrology. After graduating from Princeton University at the age of 20 with a degree in Geological Engineering, he went on to receive the nation’s first Ph.D. in Groundwater Hydrology from The University of Arizona.

Jay was a professor of Hydrogeology at The Ohio State University in the 1960s and an adjunct professor for many more years. He spent 25 years as Executive Director of the National Ground Water Association. He then spent 25 years as Senior Scientist for The Heartland Institute. Most recently, Jay was Senior Policy Advisor for the International Climate Science Coalition. Jay was passionate about educating others on the science behind the fallacy of man-made climate change.

Jay was the author of more than 1,000 magazine and journal articles and 36 books. He was editor of Rational Readings on Environmental Concerns; McGraw-Hill’s Handbook on Environmental Science, Health and Technology (2000); the six-volume Water Encyclopedia (Wiley Interscience, 2005); and Wiley Interscience’s Nuclear Energy Encyclopedia: Science, Technology, and Applications (2011).

Jay was the author of numerous publications for Heartland during his years as Science Director, testifying before Congress, state legislatures, and at administrative hearings hundreds of times. Among the most influential papers he produced for The Heartland Institute was one arguing that the U.S. EPA had long surpassed its usefulness and exceeded its authority, and should be replaced as a regulatory body by a committee composed of state Environmental Protection Agencies. While the EPA still exists, in 2016, Jay’s plan influenced the 2016 Republican Party Platform, which included provisions:

to shift responsibility for environmental regulation from the federal bureaucracy to the states and to transform the EPA into an independent bipartisan commission, similar to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with structural safeguards against politicized science. We will strictly limit congressional delegation of rule-making authority, and require that citizens be compensated for regulatory takings.

Jay was an enthusiastic proponent of these provisions, seeing them as a stepping stone to the ultimate goal of ending the EPA as we know it.

Lehr spoke in front of thousands of audiences on topics ranging from global warming and biotechnology to business management and health and physical fitness, always receiving high scores for entertaining and energizing even the largest audiences. Jay always showed up to his global warming presentations with business cards, on the back of which were a list of 10 climate myths, and a carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reader, to show students, teachers, and whoever else composed his audience that CO 2 is not a pollutant, or dangerous at any levels they are likely to encounter. Indeed, the readings of his CO 2 reader showed audience members they lived their daily lives in environments where CO 2 levels are much higher than climate scolds say are deadly to life on earth.

Jay was a participant in every International Climate Conference hosted by The Heartland Institute, and was awarded the “Dauntless Purveyor of Truth Award,” at the 13th International Conference on Climate Change in 2019. No person was ever more deserving of that award. One can view his acceptance of the award and many of his other insightful presentations here.

With his workload, it is hard to fathom how Jay found time to pursue so many extracurricular passions, but he did. Jay was known as the “Father of Western Lacrosse.” He was assistant lacrosse coach at The Ohio State University in the ’60s. He loved playing club lacrosse, hockey and men’s hardball. He founded the Columbus Metros semi-pro football team. He was an avid skydiver, 10-time Ironman finisher, and multiple marathon finisher.

Jay was a proud Princeton alum (class of ’57). He was known throughout the Princeton community for his participation in the “Princeton P-rade,” where he walked the parade route on his hands for 20 years, then completed the route annually on his unicycle for another 20 years. Jay was also known for his love of skydiving, having completed 1,481 successful jumps, always with exact precision in hitting his target, “Earth.” Indeed, Jay was featured in Parachutist, the magazine of the U.S. Parachute Association, in March 2010, for setting a new world record, having jumped from an airplane each and every month for 32 years.

Jay was the most optimistic and energetic person you will ever meet. He always inspired others to reach their highest potential. He adored his wife, Janet, and cherished doing everything together, from traveling to biking to watching Hallmark movies. Every day was Christmas Eve to Jay. In addition to Janet, he is survived by his daughters, Leslie (John Truby) Lehr and Tracy (Mike) de Martino; stepchildren, Tonia (Richard) Birt and Tom (Colleen) Kingery; grandchildren, Juliette, Caty Joy, Marie Claire, Josilynn, Spencer, Emily, Abigail, and Landon.

That’s the official stuff. All of it true.

Now for a few personal impressions. Jay was the most extreme climate skeptic I have ever known (truly sad to write that in the past tense). I heard him say on more than one occasion it was impossible that human greenhouse gas emissions were causing climate change. He thought the physics just didn’t add up.

I don’t recall ever speaking with Jay about religion, but I do know he lived his life in a way every Christian should aspire to. He lacked ego, he was exceedingly kind, he continually pursued new knowledge, and he was an eternal optimist.

Some personal recollections highlight his lack of ego and gracious embrace of criticism. I was fortunate to have edited a number of Jay’s book reviews for Environment & Climate News, his op-eds, and the quotes he provided for stories.

I have known many scholars to take every word they write as gold, with no room for improvement or leeway for alteration. They fight almost any edit to their work. Jay was not one of those writers.

In his writings, Jay wasn’t always the clearest communicator, at least not for lay audiences without a background in higher math, physics, or other scientific disciplines. Sometimes, it wasn’t clear, even to me, what exactly Jay was saying. On those occasions, rather than going back and forth with edits and corrections over multiple emails, I would call Jay directly, and he’d take whatever time it took to hash through my lack of clarity. The conversation typically proceeded in the form of a Socratic dialogue, with me asking questions about what exactly Jay was trying to communicate, asking for further clarification, sometimes offering corrections or my gloss on what he wanted to say, and finally honing in on language that clearly and simply communicated the complex idea Jay had crammed into a few jargon-laden sentences. At the end, I would write out what I understood he wanted to communicate, to which Jay would invariably say, “That’s fabulous, that’s exactly what I intended to say, Sterling, you made it so much clearer.”

I was always humbled by him saying so. Usually, my confusion wasn’t so great as to merit a phone call; often, I just thought Jay’s writing or quotes could be simpler, more direct, and more focused. On those occasions, when I edited his articles or quotes, I would always run my rewrite by Jay for approval. Jay consistently told me I didn’t need to do so, that he trusted me, and was confident if I thought a change was needed for clarity or style, he was sure it was true. I never took Jay up on that offer, thinking it improper to put my take on his words in his mouth. Jay was always effusive in his praise of my edits and rewrites.

No one has ever accused me of being an optimist, but Jay remained one until his final days. For instance, in the last podcast I conducted with Jay, he explained that, despite my gloomy prognosis, Socialism Will Not Win Despite the Current Energy/Supply Crises. I left this conversation more hopeful than when it began, but then that was true of almost every conversation or exchange I ever had with Jay.

I was truly looking forward to dining and speaking with Jay at Heartland’s forthcoming climate conference in Orlando. I always sought him out at these conferences. Now there is a hole in my schedule as well as my heart.

Coal is Still King – Elsewhere,Greg E. Walcher,"Does the rest of the world know something we don’t?

A December report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) confirms that worldwide use of coal hit an all-time high in 2022, following a huge increase in 2021, and is on track to increase further in 2023. The report was barely mentioned by most of the media. That may be because Americans have already moved beyond coal, culturally and politically. U.S. coal consumption continued to decline, bucking the global trend.

American consumers have become convinced that switching from coal to other sources is good for the environment, because it lowers carbon dioxide emissions. They are not alone in that belief. In fact, the IEA’s own press release decries the environmental impact: “That sharp rise contributed significantly to the largest ever annual increase in global energy-related CO2 emissions… [now] at their highest level in history.”

How can that be, when the U.S. – long the world’s largest energy consumer – has all but abandoned coal? That was a massive cultural and economic shift, considering that coal accounted for two-thirds of all electric generation in the U.S. a couple decades ago. American policymakers were determined, though, and the “war on coal,” as many called it, was launched with a vengeance.

Michael Bloomberg almost singlehandedly underwrote the Sierra Club’s original “Beyond Coal” campaign, to the tune of $80 million. Backed by federal anti-coal regulations under President Obama, the plan was astonishingly successful. More than half the nation’s coal plants have closed, 290 out of 530. In 2019, Bloomberg announced another $500 million campaign to “close every coal-fired power plant in the United States.”

Predictably, that success also killed many of the mines that supplied the coal for those power plants. Over 760 coalmines closed within eight years. Colorado was the eighth largest coal producing state and had over 2,000 coal miners. Half those jobs are now gone, and the state has slipped to tenth.

Colorado has only six coal-fired powerplants left – one is in the process of converting to natural gas and the other five are scheduled for permanent closure. Nationwide, another 257 coal plants are scheduled for closure, according to a Reuters report. The nation’s largest power providers – Duke, Xcel, Dominion, Alliant, Ameren, Berkshire Hathaway, and a host of others – are well on the way to abandoning their most abundant and cheapest power source.

You would think such a massive shift away from coal would alter the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, but it has had no measurable effect. There is a simple explanation. While Americans are determined to eliminate the use of coal, the rest of the world is ignoring their example, ramping up the use of coal.

The three largest coal producers – China, India, and Indonesia – all set new production records in 2022, and European Union countries substantially increased the use of coal, at least partly to wean themselves off Russian natural gas.

China consumed 4.25 billion tons of coal in 2022, and India another 1.1 billion tons. Other Asian nations accounted for another 900 million tons and the European Union nearly 500 million more. Even the United States, despite its anti-coal policies, consumed 465 million tons in 2022. Ironically, so many mines have closed that some of that coal had to be imported, mostly from Columbia, Canada, and Indonesia. Altogether, the world used over eight billion tons of coal in 2022, barely five percent of it in the U.S.



Has the rest of the world has learned something Americans haven’t? No, but others might have learned something Americans have forgotten. Namely that abundant and affordable energy creates prosperity and changes lives.

Today’s Americans may take that for granted, but they should remember even history’s richest man, John D. Rockefeller, lived without air conditioning, feared now-obsolete diseases, and traveled slowly and uncomfortably on dirt roads and dusty trains. He had many servants to prepare his food but could not get fresh peaches out of season, and never tasted a burrito, a pizza, or a Chilean sea bass. Ordinary Americans now get fresh food year-round, at reasonable prices, from all over the world. They enjoy interstate highways, international airports, central heating, indoor plumbing, regular trash pickup, and antibiotics.

Thanks to the blessings of a prosperous economy made possible by rich natural resources and abundant, affordable energy, Americans are now free of the everyday drudgery of the past – plowing fields, chopping wood, hauling water, milking cows, and dying young. The rest of the world wants to end that cycle, too, and understands the critical role of affordable energy.","January 16, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/coal-is-still-king-elsewhere/
PRESS RELEASE: U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert to Speak on Energy Policy at Heartland Institute Climate Conference on Feb. 24,Jim Lakely,"The 15th International Conference on Climate Change hosted by The Heartland Institute will feature more than 40 speakers, including Boebert, who is on the House Natural Resources Committee

Other prominent keynote speakers include Jeff Clark, former Trump Administration DOJ official; Marlo Oaks, Treasurer of the State of Utah; Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace

The conference theme is ‘The True Crisis: Climate Change or Climate Policy?’

January 16, 2023 – U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) a member of the House Resources Committee, will be a featured keynote speaker at the 15th International Conference on Climate Change, being held in Orlando, FL from Feb. 23-25, 2023.

From the green energy boondoggles in the so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” in the United States, to the ongoing wind-power disaster in Germany, and threats of energy cuts in the winter in the UK, the climate policy “solutions” are a real and growing problem for the people of the world. Why are we making life poorer and more miserable for most of the people on the planet when there is no climate crisis?

These issues and more will be discussed by scientists and policy experts at the only conference of its kind that takes a data-driven, realist approach to what is actually causing climate change and what (if anything) humans can do about it.

What: 15th International Conference on Climate Change (website)

When: February 24-25, 2023

Where: Hilton Lake Buena Vista, Orlando, Florida

Media: Apply for credentials (Jim Lakely: [email protected])

The Heartland Institute is the leading global think tank working with world-renowned scientists and policy experts–on a regular basis, and at our previous 14 conferences–who look at the data and do not see human activity causing an “existential” climate crisis. At this conference, you will hear that data-based, scientific case, why the scientific method must be restored, why the alarmist narrative must be broken, and why “green energy” is already unnecessarily causing the destruction of freedom and prosperity across the globe.

Boebert, currently scheduled to speak at around 1 p.m. on Saturday, February 24, joins other prominent elected officials or federal appointees as speakers, including:

Marlo Oaks, state treasurer of Utah. He is expected to speak about fighting the ESG (environment, social, and governance) movement in the states.

Jeff Clark, former Assistant Attorney General of the Environment & Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Justice Department in the Trump administration. He is expected to speak about legal fights against the radical Biden climate and energy agenda.

Bad Climate Assumptions, Worse Climate Predictions

“How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.” So begins Elizabeth Barret Browning’s famous Sonnet 43. What does that have to do with climate change, you ask? Browning’s poem has parallels to our understanding of the myriad physical mechanisms that drive climate change. “What affects the climate? Let me count the factors. …” Some people just don’t want to do that.

Recent research published in the International Journal of Climatology, a peer-reviewed scientific publication of the Royal Meteorological Society, suggests cycles of warming and cooling and associated climate phenomena are driven in large part by periodic solar and ocean oscillations. The well-funded researchers for the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change consistently underappreciate or ignore these factors in fashioning the climate models they use to represent the world.

Examining extended tree-ring data of the Scots pine of northern Finnish Lapland, stretching to the year 5,634 B.C, the researchers found multiple and sometimes overlapping natural cycles of various durations throughout the record, tracking temperature shifts on short, medium, and longer-term time scales. Among the most direct and profound drivers of temperature shifts on short time scales are large, powerful volcanic eruptions.

Other natural cycles that drive climate shifts of various durations, regionally and sometimes globally, are oceanic circulation patterns, including La Niña and El Niño cycles, and over longer time periods the Atlantic and Pacific multidecadal oscillations. Though these forcing mechanisms are not the focus of the paper, they are well-established in the literature. No Tricks Zone provides links to dozens, possibly hundreds of journal articles published over the past decade that suggest oceanic cycles do not just correspond to climate changes but have driven them in many instances.

The paper focuses instead on the role solar cycles of various lengths play in changing temperatures and climate. In the paper’s abstract the authors write,

The mechanism and even the existence of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) have remained under debate among climate researchers, and the same applies to general temperature oscillations of a 60–90-year period. The objective of this study is to show that these temperature oscillations are real and not artifacts and that these oscillations have different external cosmic origins. The authors have studied how well the variations of astronomical harmonic resonances (AHR) could explain the 60-year temperature variations, which are based on instrumental records. …

The similarities between the temperatures of the tree-ring trend and the AHR trend are easy to observe even by the naked eye. The statistical analysis shows that these two signals are statistically related. The analyses also show that the well-known Gleissberg cycle of 88 years is the dominating cycle caused by the Suns’ [sic] activity changes but the observed 60-year cycle can be connected to the AHR cyclicity.

The Finnish scholars are by no means the first to recognize that the Sun, the single greatest power source in our solar system, has a significant and perhaps dominant influence on climate shifts. Scholars such as Nir Shaviv, Willie Soon, the late Eigil Friis-Christensen, Sallie Baliunas, and Hans Svensmark, among many others, have spent large portions of their academic careers studying, analyzing, and describing the various ways solar activity drives periodic climate changes on Earth.

Also, rarely does the public hear anything about water vapor, which makes up 97 to 98 percent of atmospheric greenhouse gases or clouds, which, depending on the type, can have either a cooling or warming effect. This virtual media blackout happens even though hundreds of journal articles and even the IPCC attest clouds affect the climate.

Other known factors that drive major climate changes on long- and medium-term time scales are the changes in the Earth’s tilt and orbit and, over eons, continental drift. These and probably myriad other factors result in climate changes on local, regional, continental, and global scales over various time periods.

Despite all this evidence, you would not know anything other than human greenhouse gas emissions drives temperatures on the Earth and changes in the climate, if you heard only reports from the mainstream media or read the IPCC’s massive Assessment Reports. The causal mechanism behind climate change should be the strongest part of the IPCC’s reports, yet it is in fact the weakest. Although the IPCC downplays the prominent benefits humanity has been blessed with because of climate change over the past century or so, its descriptions of climate change’s impact on weather are largely sound, describing facts on the ground. The explanations for why these changes take place, however, are woefully inadequate because the IPCC has placed all its explanatory eggs in one basket: greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activities.

Interestingly, over the course of its six assessment reports the IPCC has produced multiple graphics describing a range of forcing factors, or physical mechanisms natural and anthropogenic, that influence climate. These factors have changed from report to report, with some factors being dropped from one report to the next, other factors being combined, and still others being added. Yet the only climate influences the IPCC claims to understand well, and the only mechanisms put into their climate models as forcing factors, are human greenhouse gas emissions. Natural forcing factors are either assumed to have minimal, poorly understood effects on temperatures and climate or, as with oceanic oscillations, treated as if they have no effect at all.

In contrast to natural factors that affect climate that are ignored or downplayed in the models, the models incorporate various sets of “feedback” mechanisms as temperature and climate change multipliers, enhancing the assumed warming and changes caused directly by additional CO2, methane, and other trace gases humans are adding to the atmosphere. These feedback forcings, and how they supposedly function, are based purely on speculation, assumptions built into the models, not observed behavior of the environmental mechanisms involved or data accumulated over time describing how these factors have acted in the past in response to environmental perturbations such as temperature changes.

This is emblematic of the topsy-turvy world of climate science. Scientists use climate models they know downplay or fail to account for myriad physical factors that are known to alter temperatures and climate, because they are little-understood or difficult to model, while they incorporate forcings from feedback mechanisms based purely on the assumptions of the modelers. Theory trumps fact in climate models. The outcome is assumed—carbon dioxide equals dangerous warming—with the data and assumptions forced to fit the predetermined conclusion.

This may account for why, after thirty years and six sets of assessment reports, the IPCC’s range of possible temperature outcomes has not improved and the temperature outcomes of the present iteration of models, CMIP6, are even worse than the previous generation of models at tracking actual temperature trends. Models have persistently projected warmer temperatures and steeper temperature trends than have been measured, with CMIP6 models producing hotter temperature projections than any before them. If the IPCC can’t account well for the factors that drive temperatures and climate change, and for some factors it doesn’t even try, it is no wonder the models’ projections consistently fail to match reality.

It’s like trying to build a functioning car without installing hoses or wiring. Yes, the engine, transmission, and tires are important, but so are many other systems. It ain’t going to work, and by and large climate models don’t. They produce elegant representations of a climate that does not exist anywhere but on the fictional Earth the models describe.

Climate scolds foolishly try to defend their models by saying when they run them without including human greenhouse gas emissions they don’t produce the warming the analysts expect. Well, that’s the problem, isn’t it? Their expectations are based on an incomplete understanding of the range and direction of effects of various forcing factors. Their models, focusing only on human greenhouse gases, may match their expectations of warming, but they don’t correspond to reality. What about that do the IPCC and the mainstream media not understand? In science, it is data and observation, not theory and models, that determine the state of knowledge.

To sum up: Are human greenhouse gas emissions affecting the climate? Almost certainly. How could they not do so to some degree? Are they the only factors that drive temperatures and climate change? Absolutely not. Do we know for certain that human greenhouse gases are solely or even primarily responsible for the recent changes in climate? We do not. Only those who trust the flawed models instead of hard evidence can truly believe we do. Is climate change having disastrous consequences, producing more extreme weather more frequently? The data say no.

When making energy and climate policy, these are the premises we should proceed upon. We need more knowledge, not rash actions based on flawed representations of the climate.

"Jay Lehr, R.I.P.","Jim Lakely, James Taylor","A giant of man, a brave scientist, and a dear friend passed away suddenly on Tuesday. Jay Lehr was the most-vigorous and interesting man any of us have ever met, and will probably ever meet. Irrefutable data is displayed in the picture picture at left. Jay’s family and friends, including all of us at The Heartland Institute, are still dealing with the shock.

We will have more to say about the life and work of Jay Lehr — one of the most-important and most-impactful communicators for real science on the climate in the world — in the coming days. And those thoughts will be shared and time-stamped in this post.

In the meantime, here are some videos of some of Jay’s best work about the subject that animated him like no other: convincing people that humans are not causing a climate crisis, and presenting the data to prove it.

We post this knowing that Jay climate realism was his passion, and he’d want as many people to see his work as possible — not just now, at his passing, but always.

Godspeed and rest in peace, dear friend.

Statement by James Taylor, president of The Heartland Institute:

The passing of Dr. Jay Lehr is a tremendous loss to the Heartland Institute family, to the field of science, and to the greater universe of mankind.

I first met Jay in 2001 when I joined The Heartland Institute. Back then and throughout the 20-plus years I knew him, Jay was the most enthusiastic and energetic man I knew. He was a man a tremendous intellect yet tremendous humility. He would do anything for anybody and was more than happy to allow others to take the credit for his hard work.

Jay kept up a remarkable travel schedule, constantly touring the country – and indeed the world – while spreading his love of science and agriculture. Audiences loved his energetic demeanor and encyclopedic knowledge of science. While on the road, he would tirelessly spend his evenings writing book reviews and science articles for Heartland and others. Jay was the Energizer bunny of science.

It was impossible not to smile when seeing Jay. He effused good cheer, passion, and personal warmth. During times of trouble, Jay would always go out of his way to cheer me up with his kind heart, optimism, and compassion.

It does not seem real that I will never see him again at Heartland’s climate conferences or anywhere else. I will miss you, my friend.

We talked about Jay’s passing on the January 12, 2023 live-stream of the In the Tank Podcast

Here’s Jay ending one of the most-popular videos we’ve ever uploaded to Heartland’s YouTube channel titled “Four Climate Scientists Destroy Climate Change Alarmism,” which has earned more than 700,000 views. And it was Jay’s image on the thumbnail that helped it get there.

Can Anyone Manage the Federal Estate?,Greg E. Walcher,"Remember when air travel used to fun? Big carriers like PanAm competed with TWA and Eastern, as did smaller ones like Braniff and Piedmont, each claiming to offer better food and more comfortable seats. They’re all gone now. The big mergers started in 2001 with American and TWA. Delta and Northwest merged in 2008, followed by Continental and United, American and U.S. Airways, and others. Each time, pundits invariably asked if the company might finally be too big for anyone to manage. Comedians joked about a fictitious new slogan for United Airlines: “We’re not happy ‘til you’re not happy!”

Today the nation’s largest carrier is American Airlines, followed closely by United. Between them, they have 203,000 employees, 1,634 airplanes, and serve 675 destinations. It is interesting to compare such giant companies to giant government agencies.

The federal government owns about 640 million acres of land (the size of 31 states), almost all of it managed by two presidential appointees, the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture. Under their direction, most of it is managed by five appointees: the Chief of the Forest Services, and the Directors of the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Reclamation. Those seven people are responsible for an almost unfathomable amount of land, natural resources, employees, infrastructure, and money.

The Bureau of Land Management has a $1.6 billion budget, 10,000 employees, and over 244 million acres. It is expected to manage 221 wilderness areas, 27 National Monuments, 636 National Conservation System parcels, 2,400 miles of wild and scenic rivers, 6,000 miles of national scenic and historic trails, 55 million acres of forests, 63,000 oil and gas wells, 18,000 grazing permits, 3.8 million mining claims, 309 coal mines, 46,000 abandoned mines, 5,000 miles of pipelines and transmission lines, 200,000 miles of fishing streams, 2.2 million acres of lakes and reservoirs, 6,600 miles of floatable rivers, 69 National Back Country Byways, thousands of miles of hiking, biking, and horseback trails, and 62 million recreational visitors a year.

The Fish and Wildlife Service has a similarly bewildering array of responsibilities, with a nearly $2 billion budget, 8,000 employees and 89 million acres. That includes 700 field offices, 560 national wildlife refuges, 150 million acres of wetlands and “special management areas,” six national monuments, 70 fish hatcheries, jurisdiction over 2,600 endangered species (except those under jurisdiction of the National Marine Fisheries Service) and all migratory birds.

The National Park Service has a $3.6 billion budget, 20,000 employees, 280,000 volunteers, 80 million acres, and 21,000 buildings. It manages 63 national parks, 85 national monuments, 13 national seashore/lakeshore parks, 31 national memorials, 21 preserves, 18 recreation areas, 10 wild and scenic rivers, 4 parkways, 138 historic sites, 25 battlefield and military parks, 12,250 miles of scenic trails, 85,000 miles of rivers and streams, 4.5 million acres of oceans, lakes and reservoirs, and miles of city streets in D.C.

The Bureau of Reclamation has a $1.4 billion budget, 5,000 employees, 7.8 million acres, 1,774 buildings, 304 bridges, 2,601 miles of roads, 338 reservoirs, 487 dams, and 8,116 miles of canals.

The U.S. Forest Service, part of the Agriculture Department, has a $9 billion budget, 35,000 employees, 600 ranger districts, and 193 million acres, including 154 national forests, 209 national grasslands, 80 experimental forests, and six national monuments.

Is it humanly possible, even for seven highly qualified presidential appointees, to manage all of that efficiently? Government is not even efficient enough to put all the national monuments under one agency, nor all of the forests, mines, pipelines, rivers, or endangered species. We often criticize the one-size-fits-all approach of Washington bureaucrats, but how else could they possible manage such gigantic portfolios? No genius could possibly understand the nuances of all 154 national forests, or 18,000 grazing permits.

Some organizations say the federal government simply should not own so much land, a debatable point. But the easier debate might be about management, not ownership. Might some management be contracted out to private companies? Consider that even with similarly massive facilities, employees, and resources, United and American Airlines both net over $40 billion a year, while the Interior Department costs taxpayers $18 billion.

Colorado once proposed a pilot project for state-level management of one national forest for 20 years. The State Forester was convinced that two decades of state management would leave a demonstrably healthier forest. U.S. Forest Service officials all but laughed him out of the room, but some version of state, local, or private contracting might realistically provide a much better way to manage what is now essentially unmanageable.","January 11, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/can-anyone-manage-the-federal-estate/
The Silly Giant Scale of US Offshore Wind Development,David Wojick,"The world’s biggest offshore wind array is Hornsea 2, which is 1,386 MW with a turbine size of 8.4 MW. Operational in 2022 it is the state of the OSW art. See https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_offshore_wind_farms

But Virginia’s phase 1 array is a whopping 2,600 MW, with huge 15 MW turbines. Clearly it is a giant, far bigger than anything that has ever been built. The cost is estimated as $10 billion to build.

Moreover there are a dozen or more comparable giant arrays proposed to be built at the same time, lining the Atlantic coast. Last I heard the combined proposals topped a gigantic 40,000 MW.

From an engineering point of view this is nuts. No one has ever done anything like this so let’s do a hundred billion dollars worth and see how it goes, right? Work up to it? Start small then scale up, learning as we go? None of that.

This giant offshore wind stampede is climate insanity personified.

Virginia’s developer, Dominion Energy, is especially nuts. Most projects have retained experienced European OSW builders as prime contractors. Ørsted for example is the prime for a bunch of projects. Dominion says they themselves will be the prime, with no experience at all. Oh wait, they did build two 6 MW test turbines. So practically no experience, not absolutely none.

From an environmental impact standpoint these giant arrays are far worse. Since nothing like this has ever been built there is no data on their potential impact. It could be extreme, including exterminating the severely endangered North Atlantic Right Whale, but who knows?

The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) had taken this ignorance to absurd heights. They are doing the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for each proposed project. This despite the obvious conflict of interest given their mission is to get these giants built.

Their insane argument is that since we have no impact data there is no reason not to build the damn things. Ignorance is bliss, policy-wise.

I am not making this up. Here is their explicit finding, from the EIA for Empire Wind phase 1, a true giant:

“There is a lack of research regarding the responses of large whale species to extensive networks of new structures due to the novelty of this type of development on the Atlantic OCS. BOEM determined that the overall costs of obtaining the missing information for or addressing these uncertainties are exorbitant, or the means to obtain it are not known.”

In plain English “We know nothing and can’t find out.” Here then is their nutty conclusion:

“Therefore, BOEM does not believe that there is incomplete or unavailable information on marine mammal resources that is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives.”

The information is not incomplete or unavailable because there isn’t any!

This is just self serving gibberish. There is more than enough information about smaller arrays to see what the likely destructive threats are from the giants. Plus this is another compelling reason to start small and grow, carefully observing the adverse impacts, stopping if necessary.

For example, simple extrapolation from smaller turbines indicates that the underwater noise from these giant arrays is likely to be tremendous. This could have very serious impacts on Right Whales and other critters that communicate acoustically. We have more than enough information to analyze this noise threat.

This nasty environmental issue is discussed at some length in these comments to BOEM, on their draft OSW versus Whales Strategy: https://www.cfact.org/2022/12/05/official-coalition-comments-on-boem-right-whale-offshore-wind-strategy/.

Summary: Rushing to build a big bunch of incredibly expensive giant wind arrays that are far bigger than anything built in the world to date is bad engineering and worse environmental policy.

These are silly giants. BOEM must be stopped.","January 11, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/the-silly-giant-scale-of-us-offshore-wind-development/
Vital Energy Lessons for Virginia and America,Paul Driessen,"Legislators shouldn’t Californicate Virginia or America on EVs and Green Energy

When they open their 30-day session January 11, Virginia’s Senate and House of Delegates must correct some serious energy mistakes they made two years ago, when Democrats controlled nearly the entire state government and passed the “Virginia Clean Economy Act.”

One of its party-line provisions requires that Virginia adopt California’s requirement that only low emission vehicles (LEVs) be sold by model year 2025 and only zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) by MY 2035. That means in barely twelve years only new electric vehicles (EVs) could be sold in Virginia.

Again mimicking California, in addition to EVs, the VCEA also requires a massive shift from affordable, reliable coal and natural gas-generated electricity to expensive, weather-dependent, land-intensive wind and solar electricity, stabilized and backed up by huge batteries.

As I’ve explained previously (here, here, here and here), this is unworkable. Texas, Buffalo and the Midwest have demonstrated that heavy reliance on wind and solar can bring deadly blackouts during blizzards. California told residents not to charge their soon-to-be-mandatory EVs during last summer’s heat waves, to prevent blackouts. Switzerland might ban EV charging this winter for the same reason.

The Suburban Virginia Republican Coalition PAC (SUVGOP) recognizes these realities, and understands that the wind turbines, solar panels and transmission lines will not be in Democrat strongholds like Alexandria, Arlington, Falls Church and Richmond. They will be in beautiful rural Virginia, which will also be hardest hit by bans on gasoline and diesel vehicles. SUVGOP has therefore gotten the ball rolling on reversing these ill-advised laws, by launching a campaign to repeal LEV/ZEV mandates.

SUVGOP calls its campaign “Don’t CA my VA.” (When I lived in the Centennial State, bumper stickers proclaimed a crasser version of this message: “Don’t Californicate Colorado.”)

Arguments for avoiding or terminating LEV/ZEV mandates are compelling – for Virginia and America.

While great for short hauls and some motorists, EVs don’t get you far along on your 800-mile vacation trip; recharging can take hours, depending on multiple factors; and charging stations are more limited off main highways.

You don’t want to get caught in your EV during a hurricane evacuation or blizzard, especially since already limited battery life decreases in cold weather and with heater or AC use.

EVs (and backup batteries) can burst into chemical-fueled infernos, especially if they get immersed in water. That can be catastrophic and deadly if the EV is in a home or underground garage (or on a cargo ship loaded with EVs). The fires cannot be extinguished with water.

EVs require 3-4 times more metals than internal-combustion cars: copper, iron, nickel, aluminum, cobalt, lithium, rare earths and others. Those materials don’t just appear via Materials Acquisition for Global Industrial Change mechanisms (MAGIC). They must be dug out and processed, somewhere

China’s BYD Auto company alone used 13,000 tons of copper to make EVs in 2016. Based on average porphyry ore deposits today, every 100,000 tons of copper requires processing 23,000,000 tons of copper ore, after removing 35,000,000 tons of overlying rock – using explosives and fossil fuels!

Start calculating how many billions of tons of copper and other metals and minerals would be required for all the EVs, wind turbines, solar panels, transmission lines, and grid-stabilizing and backup batteries Virginia, or your state, or the United States or entire world, are planning to mandate. Then calculate how many trillions of tons of ore that would require – and how much mining, blasting, processing and fuel.

Where will all that work take place? In whose backyards? With how much ecological destruction, air and water pollution, hazardous waste generation, slave and child labor, and human health risks?

“Clean” energy and vehicles? There may be zero emissions out of Virginia EV tailpipes – maybe even at the electricity source, if it comes from wind or solar power, when the wind is blowing and sun is shining.

But there is no “zero emissions” for mining, processing and manufacturing. It just happens somewhere else, often in Africa or Asia, often by Chinese companies – affecting someone else’s air and water quality, scenery, croplands, wildlife habitats, wildlife, health and wellbeing.

Meanwhile, millions of acres of Virginia and US lands would be covered with turbines, panels, transformers and transmission lines; millions of birds, bats and other animals would be killed annually.

Bottom line: There is no such thing as “clean, green, renewable, sustainable” energy or vehicles. It’s just a matter of where and how and how much the mining and materials processing, manufacturing and emissions take place. It’s just a matter of how good the “green” PR programs are; and whether US environmentalists, journalists and politicians recognize … or cancel and censor … these realities.

Earth’s atmospheric, oceanic and climate systems are global. The loss of habitats and species is a global problem. We should think globally, and act locally.

Regarding backup batteries, the VCEA mandates acquisition of 3,100 megawatts of storage. Assuming legislators meant 3,100 megawatt-hours, this would require some 36,000 Tesla half-ton 85-kWh modules; and it would still meet less than 1% of Virginia’s average daily electricity consumption (and less than 0.5% of its peak demand). This doesn’t include batteries to stabilize wind-solar grid fluctuations.

Virginia legislators therefore need to address these vitally important issues, as well – with some precision:

How many wind turbines, solar panels, transformers, backup/grid-balancing battery modules, and miles of new transmission lines will The Old Dominion need to replace existing coal and gas generation?

How many more will it require after half of all cars, trucks and buses are electric? After restaurants and new and remodeled homes are forced to have electric home and water heating, stoves and ovens, instead of gas – and upgrade home and neighborhood electrical systems to handle the added loads?

Where and on whose property will all these “renewable” systems and power lines be installed? How many millions of acres of land and coastal areas (and their wildlife) will be impacted? Will residents or local governments be able to veto developments? How often will eminent domain be employed?

How many millions (billions?) of tons of metals, minerals, carbon-fiber composites, plastics, concrete and other materials will be needed? How much ore, overburden and fuels? How many tons of pollution will be emitted, cumulatively, throughout the mining-processing-manufacturing-transportation process?

*How many of these materials (and turbines, panels, battery modules and transformers) will come from China or other adversarial nations, or their surrogates?

Under what pollution control, wildlife habitat and endangered species protection, workplace safety, slave and child labor, and other “responsible sourcing” laws will all this work be done?

Where will worn out, broken and obsolete solar panels, enormous wind turbine blades and other non-recyclable equipment be landfilled?

How many billions or trillions of dollars will all this cost Virginia and US ratepayers and taxpayers?

It takes more than declaring that actions taken under “clean economy” laws are “in the public interest” to make it so. It’s vital that legislators look beyond tailpipes, and beyond Virginia or US borders, to avoid destroying the planet with wind and solar, to save it from fossil fuels and “manmade climate change.”

The 2023 legislative session is a perfect opportunity to start reexamining “clean economy” assumptions, misconceptions and mandates – and implementing reality-based Environment-Social-Governance (ESG) principles. Are Virginia’s legislators up to the task?","January 10, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/vital-energy-lessons-for-virginia-and-america/
"Paul Ehrlich Predicts Imminent End of the World, Collapse of Civilization, Mass Starvation and Extinction",Clifford Thies,"Why has Ehrlich always been spectacularly wrong?

Paul Ehrlich has never been right about anything in his entire life. As he is now 90 years old, that’s saying something. On this year’s opening “60 Minutes” show, Ehrlich remains confident in the imminent end of the world, collapse of civilization, mass starvation, industrial pollution, climate change, and now … extinction.

Ehrlich, an entomologist by training, with a specialty in butterflies, thinks human beings are bound by the severe limits imposed by planet earth. Apparently he is completely unaware of such things as the domestication of fire, the invention of the wheel, and the development of counting. Is he even aware that us fleshly-skinned creatures have internal skeletons?

In his 1970 book, The Population Explosion, he said it was inevitable that there would be a mass die-in with hundreds of millions of people dying of starvation every year beginning in the 1970s. This has to rank as one of the most preposterous forecasts of all time, rivalling even the forecasts of Karl Marx.

The world will end on Y2K

The polar beer will soon be extinct

We are running out of wood (or coal, or oil)

Covid is 10,000 times worse than the ordinary flu

Hundreds of millions of people will starve to death annually

Jesus will return on October 22, 1844

Capitalist countries are becoming more and more poor and desperate

We are headed to a new ice age

We are headed to accelerating warming

We are headed both to a new ice age AND accelerating warming

Why has Ehrlich always been spectacularly wrong?

The simple reason that Ehrlich has been spectacularly wrong is that man is self-aware. Humans think and decide. They act. On the one hand, humans plus the earth is NOT a fixed total. Humans plus the earth equal a total that is not yet even imaginable. On the other hand, humans reproduce considering cost and benefit (at least when cost and benefit isn’t perverted by the government). We aren’t in a population explosion. We’re in a transition to a post-industrial revolution equilibrium.

Let us, for the moment, think the way Ehrlich thinks. He thinks any organism expands to the limits of its environment unless checked by a predator. Hence, in nature, every organism lives a precarious life, at the edge of subsistence, eating or being eaten, in a constant struggle. The world is NOT naturally in balance in the utopian sense; but, in the sense of the law of the jungle. Life is a war of all against all; where the more of your kind there are, the less there is for each of your kind, and where others of your kind are your enemy unless part of your relatively-small, cooperative group (such as your clan or tribe, and you can’t be too sure of them either).

I’ll let this thinking continue to include evolution. This thinking leads to gigantism, e.g., elephants, whales, dinosaurs, other creatures so large they don’t have a natural predator, whose numbers are only checked by the carrying-capacity of their environment. Yet, gigantism severely limits diversity, as a relatively small number of individuals come to dominate the great oceans and plains of the planet, driving lesser creatures into the crevices of the surface of the earth.

Man, by turning the earth into a garden, by regulating water flow, as well as air and water quality, by fencing-in the plains, rotating crops, herding cattle, developing inexpensive sources of energy and fertilizer, and by integrating productive activity on a global basis, makes life possible on a grander scale than the earth in its natural state – as miraculous as our planet is.

But, it doesn’t matter how demonstrably wrong is the pseudo-science of environmentalism. That thing is a religion and, so, isn’t subject to falsification.","January 10, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/paul-ehrlich-predicts-imminent-end-of-the-world-collapse-of-civilization-mass-starvation-and-extinction/
The Hydrocarbon Elephant in the Room California Governor Gavin Newsom Refuses to Address,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","California Governor Gavin Newsom refuses to address the hydrocarbon elephant in the room, namely that The End of Oil Would be the End of Civilization as the products manufactured from crude oil played a major role in building the world from one billion to eight billion people in the past 200 years.

With his narrow focus on the useless transition to so-called renewables, no matter what, Newsom is apparently unable to understand that renewables of wind turbines and solar panels cannot manufacture anything.

Today’s dangerous emphasis on wind and solar power for intermittent electricity is creating a lack of products in the future. It is also causing a shortage of fuels for planes, ships, militaries, and space programs, all of which are manufactured from the substance Newsom seems to hate most — oil, that is, black goal, Texas Tea, or petroleum. But Newsom stubbornly refuses to talk about the “products crisis” his energy policies are creating.

The governor’s efforts to tax California out of its energy crisis will fail, and consumers and businesses will pay the price. After all, 6,000 products in our daily lives are made from oil derivatives that are manufactured out of crude oil. And how about the fuels needed for the 50,000 merchant ships and the 50,000 jets in the world? They are all dependent on fuels manufactured from crude oil, the same substance that Newsom wants to eliminate.

Newsom has set aspirational goals for an energy transition, but it is only for electricity generation, from natural gas and coal electricity generation to electricity from intermittent breezes and sunshine. Newsom’s single-minded focus is to reduce emissions no matter the consequences. He fails to comprehend that, without a planned replacement for crude oil to make those same products that support the economy, limiting the crude oil will inflict massive shortages and inflation in perpetuity on everyone’s lifestyles.

Governor Newsom could benefit from a few takeaways about energy literacy that he, and others in America’s ruling class and the media refuse to discuss. Let’s list some of the more important ones:

The potential for nuclear fusion for unlimited zero-emission electricity is exciting. In the decades ahead, it has the potential to wean the world from coal and natural gas for electricity generation. But this is still a long way in the future. But fusion (and fission, used in today’s nuclear power plants), wind, solar, and hydro, ONLY generate electricity. None can manufacture any products or fuels for transportation infrastructures needed by the growing population on this planet. Crude oil is never used for generating electricity AND is virtually useless until it’s manufactured into usable products via the seven hundred refineries around the world. Again, and this cannot be over-emphasized, more than 6,000 products are made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, and the 50,000 merchant ships and 50,000 jets, militaries, and space programs are powered on fuels manufactured from crude oil. We may have long-range plans to generate electricity from wind, solar, and nuclear fusion, but no plans to replace crude oil that is manufactured into everything in our daily lives.

By continually decreasing in-state oil production, Newsom’s energy policies continue to force California, the 4th largest economy in the world, to be the only state in contiguous America that imports most of its crude oil energy from foreign countries. That dependence, via maritime transportation from foreign nations for the state’s crude oil energy demands, has increased imported crude oil from 5 percent in 1992 to almost 60 percent today of total consumption.

California’s growing dependency on other nations, some not particularly friendly to America, is a serious national security risk for all of us. It also deprives Californians of jobs and business opportunities and forces drivers to pay premium prices for fuel.

Since 1995, California’s crude oil demands have been increasing year over year, except for pandemic years. But given that maritime transportation is one of the greatest contributors of GHG emissions, the state continues to “leak” emissions to others outside the California clean air bubble.

In 2021, imported foreign crude oil approached 300,000 barrels per year. It took 150 Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) oil tankers, each with 2 million barrels of crude oil, which were required to meet the demands of California. That number of VLCCs, emit about double the annual emissions as the entire Californian transportation sector. So, even if it were necessary to decrease GHG emissions, Newsom’s approach is a total failure.

Economists and experts have consistently pointed to the same fundamental factors driving high gas prices in California: high taxes and fees, expensive environmental mandates on fuel manufacturers, and policies that limit refining capacity. All these factors create a tight market for transportation fuels.

Back in 2018, Senator John Moorlach and the senior author of this article testified in support of Senate Bill 1074, “Disclosure of government-imposed costs.” The bill would have required gas stations to post near each gas and diesel pump a list of all cost factors, all taxes, as well as the costs associated with the state’s numerous environmental regulations being imposed on the manufacturers. This transparency would help Californians understand why they are paying more than a dollar a gallon for fuel more than the rest of the country.

Newsom’s Democratic party controlled the 2018 committee considering the issue, and they clearly did not want the public to see all these costs included in the posted pump price. So, they killed the Bill from future consideration.

Today, we are hearing the same concerns that Senate Bill 1074 would have remedied. So, the Newsom energy dance continues, and Californians continue to pay the piper.

YouTube Pulls Down Heartland Institute’s Channel Just Before Live-stream with Climate Scientist Judith Curry,Jim Lakely,"The censors at YouTube justified striking down Heartland’s channel because we supposedly uttered “misinformation” about the 2020 Election. We did not. And that is very suspicious timing.

Every Friday at Noon CT, The Heartland Institute hosts a live program we call Climate Change Roundtable. It’s a timely discussion of the latest news on environment and energy policy that differs from the alarmist perspective that echoes throughout the “mainstream” media. On Friday, January 6, 2023, we were excited to have Dr. Judith Curry as our special guest for the program.

Dr. Curry is of the most well-known and popular climate scientists in America — especially because she holds views that differ from the likes of Michael Mann and other alarmists. Dr. Curry is not a “climate denier,” as Mann calls her. She’s an esteemed scientist who has looked at the data, sees a warming world, but not an impending climate catastrophe that is all the fault of human activity. For that, she is vilified by many, and feared by even more — including, apparently, the folks who decide what to ban and when on YouTube.

Heartland live-streams every show on YouTube, Facebook, and Rumble. But the vast majority of our audience — both those who participate in the chat during the live-stream and those who view it later — watch it on YouTube. Like it or not, it’s the most-popular video streaming app in the world. Freedom-oriented sites like Rumble and BitChute have a very long way to go to catch up.

Anyway, just as we were finishing our show-prep for the episode with Dr. Curry, we got a notice in the back end of our YouTube channel that we had earned a “strike” for spreading “election misinformation” in a previous video.

So, with literally just minutes to go before we were live with Dr. Curry and undoubtedly our biggest live audience yet, YouTube shut down our channel and prevented anyone from watching it there.

The previous “offending” video was an episode of Heartland’s In the Tank podcast, episode 293, which was streamed in early May 2021 — 20 months ago. YouTube did not specify what was said that violated the terms of service and the ban on “election misinformation.” And it also did not notice for nearly two years that a live-stream that almost no one has looked at since May 2021 (and would be nearly impossible to find in a general search on YouTube) was in violation of the terms of service … until just before a live-stream with a non-alarmist climate scientist was about to begin.

It is hard to believe this was just a coincidence — that the algorithm just happened to get around to catching this supposed violation by us — and it’s just our awful luck that it happened mere minutes before we were going live with Dr. Curry.

A better explanation is this: The the name “Judith Curry” was noticed by someone at YouTube — or maybe Michael Mann, who is sensitive to such things, especially regarding Dr. Curry, and he reported the stream to YouTube — and then a human being at YouTube decided that a live-stream from a “climate realist” scientist not be allowed to happen. So, the pretext of Heartland supposedly spreading “election misinformation” was invented, the strike issued, the stream stopped, and high fives all around for a job well done by the the leftist censors at Alphabet/Google/YouTube.

But, as the character of “Mr. Universe” said in the movie Serenity: “You can’t stop the signal, Mal.” And we weren’t stopped, either. You can still view our program with Dr. Curry. We don’t just broadcast live to YouTube, but also simultaneously to Rumble and Facebook. I’ve embedded the Rumble version of the program below. [NOTE: When you click the player below, if it says “blocked by an extension” and/or “loading,” just give it a minute. It might look “broken” for a bit, and then play. If you can’t watch it below at all, watch it on Rumble.]

Heartland is now banned from uploading any videos or live-streaming from our channel for a week — presumably until Friday, January 13 at around noon CT. We will report back if our appeal is heard and what YouTube says.

Oh, and as for Heartland violating YouTube’s terms of service by spreading “election misinformation” on that long-ago live-stream? Why don’t you watch and judge for yourself. While the YouTube video has been sent to the Great Digital Beyond somewhere, the Rumble version still exists. Don’t worry if you’re pressed for time. You don’t have to watch for very long. We talk about it at the top of the show and then move on to another topic after about 15 minutes.

We didn’t talk about the results of the 2020 election, nor expressed any skepticism of the results. Why? Because a year earlier we discussed the infamous Time Magazine article titled “The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election.” That story reported, in the most-positive way possible, on how the 2020 election was “fortified” by hundreds of millions of secret dollars by Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg and other big Democrat donors. Merely reading on the podcast what Time Magazine reported — essential if you’re going to talk about it — was enough to get a previous video banned, as absurd as that seems.

In this latest supposed “misinformation” live-stream podcast from May 2021 that YouTube just now noticed, we had to explain why Donald Trump was banned permanently from Facebook. Even if questioning the results of the election is an offense worthy of being banned, we did not do that. We talked about whether banning people for expressing views that are not crimes are worthy of having your ability to speak on a social media ended.

To help us battle Big Tech censorship, subscribe to Heartland’s YouTube channel, as well as our Stopping Socialism TV channel where we live-stream our In the Tank podcast every Thursday at noon CT. We are also post regular videos on Rumble, BitChute, and Facebook — so click those links to follow us there. And if you want to make sure to never miss our audio content, subscribe to the Heartland Daily Podcast wherever you get your podcasts.

PS: I realize that today is Jan. 6. I know it’s like 9/11 and Pearl Harbor Day times 100 to the unhinged left and their “mainstream” media. So maybe they cranked up the algorithm to flag any and all vids on the platform that they might have missed over the last year or two and make sure those were flagged and removed on this “special” day. But I haven’t seen any other complaints on social media about others getting the treatment Heartland got from YouTube today.

And, again: We did not question the outcome of the 2020 Election on the “offending” podcast. We said that if Trump should be banned for what he says about the 2020 election, then it should be fair game to ban Hillary Clinton for questioning the 2016 Election and Stacey Abrams saying her election for governor of Georgia was stolen. That’s it. We did not violate YouTube’s rule.","January 6, 2023",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/youtube-pulls-down-heartland-institutes-channel-just-before-live-stream-with-climate-scientist-judith-curry/

Coalition Provides 2022 Climate Fact Check

Editor’s Note: I was recently part of a coalition of climate analysts from a variety of organizations that examined some of the most prominent, egregiously wrong assertions made by the mainstream media in 2022 concerning climate change’s impacts on major events throughout the year. The analysis, “Climate Change Fact Check 2022,” was originally posted on JunkScience.com, and has been reposted elsewhere, including on Climate Realism. This document is similar to the types of exposés provided at Climate Realism daily. I encourage all my readers to check the sites maintained by the organizations who contributed to this Fact Check, regularly, if not daily. Fox News, among other media outlets, found the Fact Check compelling and wrote a story discussing it.

Climate alarmists and their media allies once again made a slew of claims about natural disasters being caused by man-made emissions in 2022. And once again, these claims clashed with reality and science.

Associated Press reporter Seth Borenstein, for example, in his recent article “New abnormal: Climate disaster damage ‘down’ to $268 billion,” reported this about the estimated costs of damage due to climate change during 2022:

“This past year has seen a horrific flood that submerged one-third of Pakistan, one of the three costliest U.S. hurricanes on record, devastating droughts in Europe and China, a drought-triggered famine in Africa and deadly heat waves all over. … Weather disasters, many but not all of them turbocharged by human-caused climate change, are happening so frequently that this year’s onslaught, which 20 years ago would have smashed records by far, now in some financial measures seems a bit of a break from recent years.”

But are damages from those disasters really attributable to “climate change” or are climate activists and their media mouthpieces just trying to surf human tragedy to advance their very political cause?

The Associated Press, a long-time major newswire service, now accepts donations specifically to fund its climate coverage. In 2022, in fact, the Associated Press admitted to receiving $8 million in donations to cover climate. The money came from very large foundations that have been pushing climate alarmism for decades, including the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Quadrivium, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Walton Family Foundation.

Is this money funding actual journalism or just rank political activism? Here are 10 fact checks of climate disaster claims made by the Associated Press and other media outlets in 2022. We report. You decide.

Pakistan Floods

Monsoon season brought heavy flooding to Pakistan, resulting in over 1,700 deaths between June and October. Media blamed climate change.

Fact Check: The 2022 monsoon season was within the range of natural variability and the wettest since 1961. If emissions are to blame, why was it so rainy then? Also average peak monsoonal rainfall actually has declined somewhat since the 1950s. Ongoing deforestation also may have made seasonal monsoon flooding worse.

Hurricane Ian

Striking in September, Hurricane Ian was one of the top three most damaging storms to strike the United States. Media blamed climate change for the storm’s rapid intensification.

Fact Check: Hurricane Ian struck during hurricane season, after a historically quiet first few months of hurricane season and amid a season of less storm activity than predicted. Moreover, Atlantic basin hurricane activity is within natural variability, according to NOAA.

European Drought

Europe experienced its most severe drought in 500 years, as reported by BBC News.

Fact Check: The European megadrought of 1540 occurred before coal-fired power plants, SUVs and cheeseburgers. If emissions caused the drought, what caused it in 1540?

China Drought

China experienced “record drought” in 2022.

Fact Check: While The New York Times labeled China’s drought as “record” as it was supposedly the most extreme drought since records began in 1865, research reports severe megadrought in China as far back as 1637, amid a period called the Little Ice Age.

Famine on the Horn of Africa

Drought and famine struck the Horn of Africa this year, threatening starvation for as many as, for example, 300,000 in Somalia. “Climate change underpins this continued lack of rainfall,” the media reported.

Fact Check: There is no trend in rainfall in the Horn of Africa since 1990. So while the drought may be due to lack of rainfall, droughts are natural and periodic in the region and the lack of rainfall cannot be attributed to emissions. Famine in Somalia is more properly attributed to internal politics and conflict. While Somalia’s neighbors, Ethiopia and Kenya, have also been affected by regionwide drought, political stability has nonetheless allowed crop production in those states to increase, while instability in Somalia has had the opposite result.

UK Heat Wave

Britain experienced several brief heatwaves in the summer, which were worsened by climate change, per The New York Times.

Fact Check: Heat waves have dramatically declined in frequency and duration in the United States over the past 90 years, per the National Climate Assessment. So, it is unlikely emissions are increasing heat waves in Britain. Moreover, during the UK heatwaves, average global warming remained fairly constant at 0.2°C to 0.3°C (0.36°F to 0.54°F) over the 1979-2000 average global temperature, an amount of warming that is not even really measurable. So, it may have been hot in the UK, but that was offset by cooling elsewhere. As pointed out by meteorologist Cliff Mass, heat waves may bring temperatures 30°–40°F above normal, but global warming is within the noise level at 1°–2°F.

Yellowstone River Flooding

Few in the media went so far as to say last summer’s Yellowstone River flooding was climate change, but they did the next best thing: “Experts say Yellowstone Flooding is a sign of things to come.”

Fact Check: The New York Times correctly prefaced its version of the above-captioned statement with: “It is difficult to directly connect the damage in Yellowstone to a rapidly warming climate — rivers have flooded for millenniums…” This year’s flood was related to an above-average snow pack that thawed just as massive rains came through. Cold weather + bad luck ≠ “climate change.”

Lake Mead

Scientists blamed historically low water levels in Nevada’s Lake Mead on climate change in The Wall Street Journal.

Fact Check: Data show no trend in natural water flows into Lake Mead since 1930. Since 2000, drawdowns of water from Lake Mead have been greater than natural inflows. The El Niño phenomenon, which is not emissions related, may also play a lesser role in Lake Mead water levels.

World Cup Skiing

“In this World Cup season, climate change is winning,” blared a Washington Post headline in November. Shorter winters were blamed for it being cold enough to hold only one of eight races as of mid-November.

Fact Check: First, winter doesn’t begin until December 21. Next, when World Cup skiing started in the 1960s, the season began in January. Now it begins in October, which is early- to mid-autumn. If the competition began in the winter everything would likely be okay because wintertime snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing since the 1960s.

The Bottom Line: There is not a single natural disaster, nor trend in any type of natural disaster, that can be credibly linked with emissions or whatever gradual “climate change” may be occurring for whatever reason, including natural climate change. Attributing natural disaster damages to emissions and climate change is without a factual or scientific basis. And that certainly goes for 2022.

Regardless of one’s view of what passes as “climate science,” the good news is that even researchers who believe that “climate change” is a problem acknowledge the number of weather-related deaths and the cost of weather-related damage are actually on the decline—despite ever-increasing emissions and whatever slight warming may be occurring.

Climate Change Likely Not Accelerating, Human Impact Swamped By Nature

Recent research published in the peer reviewed Journal of Climate suggests factors other than human carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for recent warming—warming that, by the way, is much less than projected by climate models and estimates of climate sensitivity.

A team of researchers from Oxford University and the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, find recent increases in radiative forcing are due not to higher carbon dioxide concentrations but rather the result of aerosol emission reductions as industrial emissions are declining due to technological improvements and to comply with regulations.

The researchers suggest the reduction in aerosols combined with natural factors which drive temperature changes could account for the entirety of the warming experienced in recent decades. If this research is correct, humans are contributing to warming, just not via the emission of greenhouse gases. Rather “anthropogenic” warming is due primarily to the reduction of pollution allowing more solar radiation to reach the surface. On this theory, the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on temperatures is greatly overstated, which may explain why climate models, in which greenhouse gases are assumed to be the driving force behind temperature trends, consistently overstate the amount of warming the Earth has, in fact, experienced.

Demographic and Economic Trends Refute Climate Doomsday Claims

A recent paper by Vijay Jayaraj, a research associate with the CO2 Coalition, examines the demographic and economic trends since the end of the Little Ice Age—the period during which the Earth has modestly warmed—and finds they refute claims commonly made by government funded researchers and the mainstream media that human-caused climate change is making it harder for humans to survive and modern civilizations to flourish.

Jayaraj writes that human societies have flourished during the last three centuries as the Little Ice Age began to wane in the later part of the 17th century. Jayaraj writes:

The Little Ice Age disrupted global plant growth and fostered periods of famine, disease and mass depopulation. However, since the advent of modern warming there has been an overall greening of the planet, more bountiful crop harvests and an eight-fold increase in humanity’s numbers. Contributing to the bounty has been the fertilization effect of carbon dioxide, whose atmospheric concentration has increased in recent decades.

Among the trends Jayaraj lists which evince the fact humans are greatly benefiting from the modest warming of the Earth are:

Global maize (corn) production was approximately 205 million tons in 1961. Today the world produces five times more maize—1.16 billion tons—with similar results for all other major food crops, like rice, wheat, soybeans, cereals, nuts, and vegetables, as discussed in dozens of posts on Climate Realism.

Captures of marine fish during 1961–2018 increased from 34 million tons to 84 million tons. During the period, aquaculture production increased from two million tons to 82 million tons.

Malnourishment in developing countries fell drastically from 34 percent in 1970 to 13 percent in 2015, despite a rapidly growing population.

Other evidence of human progress amid climate change during the past century Jayaraj discusses are the facts that humans are living longer than ever before, infant and childhood mortality have declined dramatically, transportation has become more affordable and readily available to billions of people, billions of people have access to electricity (which has powered industrial development to a degree not seen before), and fewer people die as a result of weather related events than ever before.

No, Global Warming Isn’t Making Winter Weather Worse

Following Democratic operative Rahm Emanuel’s famous dictum to never let a crisis go to waste, Bloomberg, Forbes, The Guardian, and The New York Times all recently opined climate change was at least partly responsible for the recent bout of extreme, deadly, winter weather that swept the United States.

However, as Ross Clark detailed in a recent article in The Spectator, since there is no evidence weather trends are worsening, or that extreme weather events are becoming more common or severe, climate change can’t be making the weather worse in any measurable sense. Indeed, as Clark writes, “there is compelling evidence to the contrary.”

Clark points out, on cold spells, “the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] IPCC’s sixth assessment report, published in 2021, cited a number of analyses showing that ‘cold spells have undergone a reduction in magnitude and intensity in all regions of North America.’”

Nor has the polar vortex been altered due to climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) debunked that claim in February 2021, showing that since the 1950s, polar vortex incursions into the continental United States have become less frequent and severe. And the jet stream has “wobbled,” waxing and waning, with no consistent relation to changing climate conditions.

The reporting on recent severe winter weather events says more about the mainstream media’s commitment to pushing the narrative humans are causing a climate catastrophe than it does about climate change itself or the facts about it. As Clark sums up:

In other words, this week’s weather in the US is just that: weather. But that will never do when you are trying to tell a morality tale about humans fouling their own nest through their own arrogance and stupidity: every adverse weather event must be blamed. (emphasis added).

Big Tech’s Fake ‘Green Energy’ PR Push – To Paper Over Their Obnoxiousness,Seton Motley,"Big Tech’s fake “green” PR push – is the tip of their world domination ice berg. Below the surface – are their massive bureaucrat political donations and post-government gigs and salaries.

Let us begin this exercise with:

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is NOT a pollutant. The modern Zeitgeist’s stupidity notwithstanding.

The Latest from Seton Motley is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

Don’t believe me? Ask a tree.

God in His infinite wisdom set up on this planet a perfect symbiotic relationship between His flora and His fauna.

We animals inhale oxygen – and exhale carbon dioxide.

All things plant inhale carbon dioxide – and exhale oxygen.

It’s perfect.

So if you want to be a true tree hugger? Don’t hate – respirate.

It is the height of idiotic irony that the “green” movement – is looking to outlaw and abolish the fundamental component of what makes the planet green.

Oh: And all the planet’s flora and fauna are carbon-based life forms. So please: Tell me again how I’m on the anti-science side of things.

Oh: And this whole “green energy” nonsense – is nonsense. It is neither green – nor energy.

Why “Green” Energy Is a Terrible Idea

Worse Than Fossil Fuels? Why Bioenergy Is Not Green

Green Energy Fiasco: Prepare for Power Shortages & Possible Blackouts

Green Energy Too Expensive

Unfortunately, we currently live in The Fact Free Age. And a key, corrupt component of today’s corrupt Zeitgeist?

If you pose and preen about being “green?” You can actually do whatever you want – no matter how much it violates the actual tenets of being “green.”

And it buys you near infinite permission to do all sorts of other awful things.

Big Tech companies – are the hugest companies in the history of our blue-green planet. And they make their many trillions of dollars – electronically. Which means…they use a LOT of electricity.

Big Tech’s Carbon Problem:



“Energy-guzzling data centres and supply chains mean our online lives leave a heavy environmental footprint.”

Very heavy:

“‘In the past 10 years, there has been a clear trend in the rise of extremely large data centers that are commonly owned – or contracted – by large technology companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple”….

“‘The combined power requirements of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Apple are more than 45 terraWatt hours per year (TWh/yr), more than Hong Kong. That amount will grow, as the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning demands more computing power.’…

“The energy use of all data centers is now over 200 TWh/yr. Only 22 countries in the world use more energy….”

I’ll say it one additional time: The whole “green” thing is utter nonsense.

But I’m not the one insisting the planet de-carbonize – and go to fake “green” energy.

Big Tech is. In word, anyway:

“Tech companies have adopted some of the world’s most ambitious climate targets, amid having to face increasing political scrutiny about their growing economic power….”

Five Ways Big Tech Could Have Big Impacts on Clean Energy Transitions

“Could.” As in maybe. As in might. As in – not actually gonna happen.

Because fake energy – produces nowhere near enough juice for Big Tech. And almost certainly never, ever will.

Sure, Big Tech will spend lots of money on fake energy. Because they are in the money printing business – and they can afford to pay for the optics.

Big Tech’s Renewable Energy Spend: Is This ‘Greenspinning’?

Indeed it is:

“Renewables enjoy an overwhelmingly positive perception among the public….At the same time, the public conversation about the responsibilities of big business, both to their customers and the planet, has become louder and more sophisticated….”

Zeitgeist, anyone?:

“To put it bluntly, the tech behemoths need all the good PR they can get. And it just so happens that committing to serious emissions curbs is one such reputational shot in the arm.”

You know what helps Big Tech – besides its fake “green” PR work?

Massive political donations – and massive salaries for government officials when they stop being government officials.

All of which combine – to allow Big Tech to buy a full panoply of government policy.

Here in the US, Big Tech runs a sizable portion of DC. Nothing happens there – UNLESS Big Tech wants it to happen. Nothing happens there – UNTIL Big Tech wants it to happen. And DC will push, and push, and push – until it delivers what Big Tech wants.

Speaking of fake PR efforts….

DC is very good at looking and sounding like they are going to do something about Big Tech. Things are always…on the verge of happening. But nothing ever actually happens:



“DC has talked about doing something about data privacy for years. But magically – nothing ever happens.

“‘After 20 Years of Debate, It’s Time for Congress to Finally Pass a Baseline Privacy Law’

“Still hasn’t happened. Bet me it will. I’ll take the over on ‘Never.’

“Having failed to rein in Big Tech’s Surveillance Capitalism when Big Tech wasn’t quite so big – DC has now turned to talking a big game about antitrust legislation to shrink the monsters it helped create.

“‘Congress Looks to Break Up Big Tech With Bold New Antitrust Bills’

“But Frankenstein’s monsters don’t want any antitrust law either.

“‘With Landmark Antitrust Legislation Looming, Big Tech CEOs Pay a Visit to Congress:



“‘Big Tech is bringing out its heaviest hitters to influence the members whose votes could decide the bill’s fate.’

“So I’ll bet DC ends up making just as much substantive progress on antitrust – as they have on privacy.”

Meanwhile, Big Tech enjoys so much government cronyism. None of which is in any serious danger of ever going away:

“As ineffectual as DC has been in reining in Big Tech? They were quite effective in jump-starting their monsters.

“‘How Did Big Tech Get So Big? Massive Government Cronyism – Like Section 230

“Section 230?:



“‘Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act gives online platforms a liability shield when they take a ‘good faith’ approach to moderating user-generated content on their services.’

“Big Tech’s monsters grew monstrous under the massive, protective government blanket afforded them by Section 230. No apparent matter that Big Tech’s “good faith” has never been very good….

“‘“In Bad Faith”: Big Tech’s Growing Conservative Censorship’

“Congress pretends it intends to rein in the hugest cronyism in the history of cronyism….

“‘Democrats and Republicans Agree That Section 230 Is Flawed’

“But Big Tech’s monsters want Section 230 to remain in place as is…

“‘Big Tech CEOs Defend Section 230 In Acrimonious Senate Hearing’

“So DC will continue to deliver inaction – to protect its original Big Tech crony action.

“‘Why Congress Is Never Going to Fix a Legal Shield That Big Tech Loves’”

And if Big Tech wants even more cronyism? DC never rests – until they deliver it:

“DC is repeatedly hyper-active in its pursuit of the Big Tech cronyism known as Net Neutrality. Because Big Tech really wants it.

“‘Another Big Tech Crony Free Ride That Needs to End:



“‘Big Tech demands government impose Net Neutrality – because it guarantees them huge government-mandated benefits.

“‘To name but one:

“‘As mentioned, Big Tech consumes way more than half of all US bandwidth. Net Neutrality – mandates they not be charged any money for any of it.

“‘We the Little People would pay MUCH more for our service – to subsidize the likes of Apple, Amazon and Google.

“‘Net Neutrality is massive government regulation – to impose massive Big Tech cronyism.’

“Congress has never passed a law containing the phrase ‘Network Neutrality.’ So there is zero legal authority for anyone in DC to impose it.

“But that has not stopped DC’s Denizens from repeatedly, unilaterally, illegally imposing it. And promising to impose it yet again. Because Frankenstein’s monsters demand continued cronyism feedings.”

Big Tech’s fake “green” PR push – is the tip of their world domination ice berg.

Below the surface – are their massive bureaucrat political donations and post-government gigs and salaries.

And the USS United States – remains on a collision course.","December 22, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/big-techs-fake-green-energy-pr-push-to-paper-over-their-obnoxiousness/

VANGUARD ABANDONS NET ZERO ALLIANCE … GREEN ENERGY COMPONENTS ARE LIKE BLOOD DIAMONDS … WRANGEL ISLAND REINDEER KILLED BY ICE … BRITAIN IS BURNING COAL AGAIN, TO AVOID POWER OUTAGES …

VANGUARD ABANDONS NET ZERO ALLIANCE

Vanguard Group Inc., an American investment advisor with approximately $7 trillion in global assets under management, announced it has withdrawn from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative, “the main financial alliance on tackling climate change.”

Facing mounting pressure from Republican U.S. politicians over the company’s use of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in picking and managing securities, plus evident investor confusion over Vanguard’s guiding investment philosophy and goals, Vanguard stated,

We have decided to withdraw from NZAM so that we can provide the clarity our investors desire about the role of index funds and about how we think about material risks, including climate-related risks—and to make clear that Vanguard speaks independently on matters of importance to our investors.

States were asking the federal government to look into Vanguard’s activities, NewsBusters reports:

[I]n November, 13 Republican attorneys general “filed a rare motion” asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) “to prevent” Vanguard from purchasing shares of publicly listed utility companies due to its particular obsession with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing. NZAM members [have] reportedly committed to “achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

Bloomberg speculated Vanguard’s size and influence in the investment industry will make its exit from NZAM a setback for the group’s attempt to force an end to the production and financing of fossil fuels. Vanguard insists its withdrawal “will not affect our commitment to helping our investors navigate the risks that climate change can pose to their long-term returns.”

Despite the prominence the mainstream media generally give to climate change and climate policy, NBC Nightly News, ABC World News Tonight, and CBS Evening News did not cover Vanguard’s decision on the day it was announced, in contrast with all the prominent the financial press outlets, NewsBusters notes.

GREEN ENERGY COMPONENTS ARE LIKE BLOOD DIAMONDS

In a recent Washington Times commentary, Rick Amato of Amato Wealth Management Group and a primetime national TV host at OAN, and Ronald Stein, an energy policy advisor for The Heartland Institute, say the materials needed to power the green energy transition wealthy elites in developed countries are demanding are the equivalent of blood diamonds: built on slave and child labor in developing countries, destroying the environment in the process of extraction. Amato and Stein write,

Today it is the green movement, which is dominated by poorer developing countries mining the exotic minerals and metals that support the wealthy countries that are going green at a great cost to humanity. The wealthy countries understand that developing countries have virtually no environmental laws or labor laws, which allows those locations unlimited opportunities to exploit people with yellow, brown, and black skin and inflict environmental degradation on their landscapes. Showing no moral or ethical concerns for the disposable workforce, wealthy countries continue to encourage subsidies to procure electric vehicles and build more wind and solar energy infrastructure.

Stein and coauthor Todd Royal examined this subject in detail in their 2021 Pulitzer Prize-nominated book Clean Energy Exploitations. They revealed the environmental devastation and human degradation the green energy revolution is built upon, and they discussed how proponents of and profiteers from the falsely labeled “green” energy transition are less than transparent about the immoral conditions their pet green energy policies create.

“In … developing countries, mining operations exploit child labor and are responsible for egregious human rights violations of vulnerable minority populations,” write Amato and Stein. “These operations are also directly destroying the planet through environmental degradation.”

Even President Joe Biden seemingly acknowledged green energy components are morally compromised as they are currently produced, declaring in November batteries from China depend on child labor and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) was adding lithium-ion batteries “to a list of goods made with materials known to be produced with child or forced labor under a 2006 human trafficking law.” The DOL also added polysilicon from China, a critical component of solar panels, to the list of materials produced using slave or forced labor.

Will the morally compromised nature of these minerals and rare earth elements critical to wind and solar power and electric vehicles affect the developed world’s push for green energy? Only time will tell, but so far the signs aren’t good and I doubt it.

WRANGEL ISLAND REINDEER KILLED BY ICE

Research published in the journal BioOne Complete finds brown bears have been located on Wrangel Island for the first time.

In the process of confirming the brown bear’s presence on the island, the researchers also examined the status of eight other mammal species, some long endemic and others introduced to the island in the twentieth century. Lemmings, arctic foxes, and polar bears have resided on the island for hundreds to thousands of years, whereas wolves, muskox, and reindeer did not exist on the island before they were introduced there by conservationists in the twentieth century, even though sea ice sometimes connects Wrangel Island to the mainland. Some breeding-age reindeer were introduced to the island in the 1950s, and their population grew.

Although climate alarmists regularly argue the warming Arctic endangers the species that currently thrive there, it seems unusually cold weather and repeated icing episodes between 2002 and 2007 caused reindeer numbers to plummet, from 8,500 to between 400 and 500 individuals, within five years. The thick, hard ice covered the tundra moss, lichen, and grasses caribou and reindeer rely upon for their diets. Unable to get through the ice to reach their food, reindeer starved by the thousands.

“After several winters with ice-crust formation and rain-on-snow events, the population of reindeer decreased from 8,500 in 2002 to 450-500 in 2007,” write the researchers in the BioOne Complete study.

Commenting on the sharp decline in reindeer numbers on Wrangel Island, the authors at No Trick Zone write,

Great die-offs are actually quite common on Wrangel Island and other nearby Arctic sites. But the mass deaths are not due to climate warming. The opposite, actually. Winter in the Arctic is excruciatingly cold, and food is scarce due to excessive ice coverage. Nearly all deaths occur during these colder months. For example, the icing of the snowpack in the winter of 2003 led to 20,000 musk-oxen deaths on Banks Island [a 2019 study found].

Various strands of evidence suggest the Arctic was warmer several thousand years ago than at present, allowing grazing megafauna such as wooly mammoths to graze on grass there year-round. Mammoths survived on Wrangel Island thousands of years after they went extinct on the mainland. This changed approximately 3,700 years ago. Now, it appears, the Arctic environment is too hostile for even normally well-adapted species such as reindeer to flourish there.

BRITAIN IS BURNING COAL AGAIN, TO AVOID POWER OUTAGES

Britain’s National Grid company announced it is restarting two coal-fired reserve power plants as an energy crisis caused by an unusually cold winter and lack of wind to power the country’s North Sea offshore wind facilities threaten the country with blackouts.

“We’ve issued a notification to warm two winter contingency coal units,” National Grid said in a statement posted on social media. The company said the measure “should give the public confidence in Monday’s energy supply.”

Much of Britain’s fossil fuel-powered domestic generating capability has been shuttered over the past couple of decades, especially its coal-fueled power plants, as Conservative and Labour governments alike embraced the EU’s climate agenda. The governments have sharply curtailed the use of fossil fuel to generate electricity, replacing it with intermittent, expensive, renewables.

As has been true everywhere this agenda has been adopted, higher energy prices and periodic power shortfalls have become common in Britain.

“BBC Radio 4 and the Grid are to talk about using more old coal power stations as it is cold with little wind,” Sir John Redwood, a veteran Conservative MP who served in the governments of Sir John Major and the late Margaret Thatcher, told Breitbart. “Why were they not interested in this before when some of us warned them this could happen?”

“We should not be worrying about keeping the lights on, relying on imports,” Redwood said.

Despite the looming power shortfalls, environmental groups are protesting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to approve Britain’s first new coal mine in decades. For the activists, the reality of U.K. residents having to shiver in the dark as their heat and power fail this winter is not as important as the theoretical consequences of the use of coal on climate change 100 years from now. Talk about misplaced priorities!

2022’s EXTREME WEATHER NOT UNUSUAL IN THE UNITED STATES

As 2022 draws to a close, Roger Pielke Jr., Ph.D. has done the world a service by summarizing the year’s extreme weather conditions before government bureaucrats start to hype climate alarm based on the misleading use of cherrypicked data. Pielke compares this year’s weather to the long-term trends for various types of extreme weather, writing,

[I]t is not too early to look back at how 2022 looks in a historical context. I wanted to get this out before NOAA blasts out its “billion-dollar disaster” press kit, along with the implication that damage from disasters tells us something about extreme weather. If you want to understand trends in extreme weather, look at weather data, not economic data. In a few words, extreme weather in 2022 in the U.S. has been pretty normal. Some extreme weather phenomena occurred at a rate or intensity greater than historical averages, but many occurred less.

Pielke finds that in 2022,

Maximum temperatures were slightly higher than the historical average but lower than those experienced in the 1930s. The severity and extent of drought were slightly above the average for the twenty-first century, but over the past 100 years drought has modestly declined in the continental United Sates. (See figure below.) Source: NOAA The number and intensity of tropical cyclones were average to below-average in 2022. (See table below.) The incidence of tornadoes was below the average of 2005-2021. Hail was below the average of 2005-2021, with each of the last 11 years being below that average. The incidence of strong winds was slightly higher than the average since 2005, though six of the last 10 years have experienced below-average winds. Fire was consistent with the post-2000 average. Although the full data is not yet available, the preliminary data suggest flooding and extreme precipitation in 2022 were consistent with the post-2000 average.

In short, 2022’s extreme weather rates were well within the norm for the twenty-first century and even for the past 100 years.

It is worth noting Pielke’s findings for 2022 are consistent with what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s AR6 report concluded regarding extreme weather over the past century: no discernible climate change impact on extreme weather events, and no confidence that extreme weather trends can be attributed to human activities.

Today’s Economic Challenges Exacerbated by Ponzi Schemes,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","To begin with, we have the ongoing national debt Ponzi scheme being perpetrated on US taxpayers. The unsustainable national debt is the elephant in the room that the ruling class and the media refuse to talk about.

Under President George W Bush, the national debt doubled , from $5 to $10 trillion. President Barack Obama said, “hold my beer” doubling it again under his 8-year term from $10 to $20 trillion. Under President Donald Trump, the debt still crept upwards, but COVID pushed it into the stratosphere, with relief funds and paying Americans to not work. President Joe Biden has kept his foot on the accelerator and now with the national debt clock exceeding $31 trillion , there is with no sign of slowing, much less stopping.

The national debt Ponzi scheme is resulting in inflation and shortages in perpetuity.

The recent collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency crisis has earned its previous CEO Sam Bankman-Fried comparisons with Bernie Madoff , a Wall Street financier who ran the largest Ponzi scheme in history. The FTX now-former CEO had unintentionally described crypto staking or yield farming as essentially a Ponzi scheme.

Today, we have an ongoing “green” Ponzi scheme of net zero emissions by ridding the world of the fossil fuels whose manufactured products, fuels, pesticides, and fertilizers, caused the world to populate from 1 to 8 billion in less than 200 years, right AFTER the discovery of oil, in favor of wind and solar that CANNOT MANUFACTURE anything for society.

Like the national debt, the unsustainable reduction in products from fossil fuels that support the world is another elephant in the room that the ruling class and the media refuse to talk about.

Today, we have 8 billion on this planet that are surviving because of all the products, fuels, pesticides, and fertilizers MANUFACTURED from fossil fuels.

Today, the NEEDS of those 8 billion are increasing for everything that is manufactured from fossil fuels to stay alive. As more come out of poverty, the demand for those manufactured items is accelerating.

The green movement has no plan to replace all that is manufactured from fossil fuels, just a plan to only generate electricity from breezes and sunshine.

Interesting, everything that needs electricity is made with the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, including all the parts of wind turbines, solar panels, and EV vehicles. In an all-electric world, there will be nothing to power without oil!

Like the national debt Ponzi, the shortages of the products, fuels, pesticides, and fertilizers MANUFACTURED from fossil fuels will also contribute to shortages and further inflation in perpetuity.

Thus, we may get to the net-zero emissions society that we had in the 1800’s when there were no coal-fired power plants, no natural gas power plants, and no crude oil to be manufactured at refineries into usable products, but with a few billion less people on this planet that will die from starvation, diseases, and weather-related fatalities.","December 9, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/todays-economic-challenges-exacerbated-by-ponzi-schemes/
COP 27 Will End Up as FLOP 27,H. Sterling Burnett,"The 27th Conference of the Parties (COP 27) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has come and gone. In its aftermath, I say now what I said before: “Actions speak louder than words.”

Judging by the effect of past climate agreements on the actions of nations around the world, the agreements reached at the COP 27 meeting held in Egypt in November are probably not worth the paper they are printed on. Almost certainly the tons of emissions generated by the 20,000 or more celebrities, business elites, NGOs, politicians, and bureaucrats who attended COP 27 will be greater than any emission reductions generated by the agreements made at the conference itself.

Environmentalists were discouraged by COP 27. Going into the conference, they demanded governments make firm commitments to end the use of fossil fuels by a date certain, saying that is the only way to avert a climate catastrophe. Their demand was unrealistic to the point of being idiotic. Unsurprisingly, they did not get their way.

Before the conference, developing countries made it clear they wanted to focus on getting reparations for climate harms they claimed developed countries’ fossil fuel use had imposed on them. They wanted the developed countries to establish and finance a “loss and damage” fund. Estimates of the necessary size of the fund to compensate the developed world fully for present and future damages were in the trillions of dollars. Developed countries had long fought the idea they owed climate reparations. Instead, as I discuss below, previous COPs committed to establish a Green Climate Fund.

At the outset of COP 27, U.S. President Joe Biden signaled he was open to negotiating a “loss and damage” agreement, but only if China agreed to participate and contribute. By the end of COP 27, it became clear Biden had been bluffing, and his red line was erased as if it had never existed. Biden committed the United States to contribute to a reparations fund even though China flatly rejected participating in any other way than as a recipient of payments. You read that right: the world’s biggest emitter by far wants to be compensated for the greenhouse gas emissions its economic competitors emit. Biden agreed to that.

In the end, although the developed world agreed to finance a loss and damage fund, it is likely to end up like previous commitments: all talk and no action. The loss and damage agreement is more an agreement to agree than an actual commitment to provide money. Biden couldn’t do that if he wanted to without running it past Congress, the governing body that controls the purse strings. As The Hill points out, the agreement contains no specifics about who will provide the funds or how much the various countries will pay into it. It sets no hard deadline to establish the fund or to start the payments. It describes no mechanism for paying out the funds, how much goes to which countries, and the conditions for receiving payments.

The problem with this agreement was described aptly more than 370 years ago in Thomas Hobbes’ rightly still-discussed book Leviathan: “Covenants, without the sword, are but words and of no strength to secure a man at all.” There is no sword backing this loss and damage agreement, just as there was no sword backing any of the agreements that emerged from the previous 26 COPs.

A brief review of the history of these agreements confirms Hobbes’ insight.

In 1992, 165 countries signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), agreeing to “stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.” To do so, 43 industrialized countries agreed to implement voluntary measures to stabilize their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. They missed that target badly. Twenty-two years after the deadline, that goal has gone unmet and carbon dioxide emissions have increased.

In 1997, parties to the UNFCC negotiated a new treaty: the Kyoto Protocol, with the same developed countries agreeing to legally binding greenhouse gas emission reductions averaging 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.

History repeated itself. The parties to the Kyoto Protocol missed their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets by a wide margin—with no penalties forthcoming.

In the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 196 countries agreed to cut or stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at levels necessary to prevent the Earth from warming two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The U.N. estimated this would mean cutting global greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2030 and producing net-zero emissions by 2050. In the meantime, the countries set interim timetables with specific emission reduction targets.

Seven years on, no country has met its commitments, and global carbon dioxide emissions are still increasing. The Paris agreement, for all the lofty words spoken in support of it in repeated COPs since then, has not accomplished any of its goals.

Also at Paris in 2015, world governments agreed to provide $100 billion to a Green Climate Fund (GCF) each year—a fraction of what the new loss and damages agreement would require. The GCF was created to help developed countries adapt to future changes to the climate. As with the carbon dioxide emissions reductions in Paris, nations were not legally bound to fund the GCF, and in fact they have not done so. In the seven years since the GCF was established, nowhere near $100 billion in total has been provided to it, much less the $100 billion annually required by the agreement.

Despite all the emissions spewed, protests undertaken, five-star meals shared, solemn presentations made, blustery speeches given, and treaties and agreements signed, 27 COPs have produced no emission reductions. Despite a significant decline in emissions from developed countries relative to the trend in developing countries since the first treaty was signed in 1992, not only have emissions increased overall, they have increased at the rate that in 1992 was basically considered business as usual—the rate that was projected to come to pass if no one did anything at all to cut emissions (see the figure below). This happened despite the imposition of numerous regulatory restrictions and taxes on fossil fuel development and use, plus hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to transition to greener technologies.

That’s covenant without the sword, folks. Honestly, we can all be happy there is no sword, because the goals proposed in these various climate agreements would have set back the world’s economic development by decades, if not centuries. The idea of ending fossil fuel use by government fiat, when no equivalent replacement is waiting in the wings, puts me in mind of another justly famous Hobbes quote: life in such a society would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Imagine that future as the Donner Party, not the garden of Eden.

Switzerland Mulls Power-Induced Electric Vehicle Ban … France Reluctantly Reembraces Coal … Offshore Wind Projects Hurt Ocean Life

SWITZERLAND MULLS POWER-INDUCED ELECTRIC VEHICLE BAN

The Swiss government, like other European governments, has pushed the replacement of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines with electric vehicles as a way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the nation’s carbon dioxide reduction commitments.

Unlike in most nations, this would reduce emissions from Switzerland because transportation is the largest source of Switzerland’s emissions. Switzerland’s electric power supply comes almost entirely from renewables (a little over 70 percent) and nuclear (28.9 percent). Hydropower by itself, long a mainstay of Switzerland’s power grid, accounts for 87 percent of the renewable electric power generated, with solar, wind, and biomass and waste incineration accounting for the remaining renewable power.

Despite this, the Swiss government is now considering banning the use of electric vehicles for “nonessential” purposes. No pleasure trips or holiday outings, no visits to friends or relatives for electric vehicle owners. Switzerland’s electric power supplies are tight, and using electric vehicles, which of course requires charging them, is to be discouraged in order to avoid “load shedding,” meaning planned outages for specific customers or neighborhoods.

Breitbart notes other electric power saving laws are being considered: “limiting the total speed of cars, reducing the opening hours of shops as well as the amount of heating permitted at nightclubs.”

The Swiss government, like the leaders of other European nation, is blaming lack of access to Russian gas. That claim rings hollow. Although Switzerland did rely on Russian imports for approximately 43 percent of the natural gas it used before the Ukraine invasion, almost all of that gas is for home heating or industrial and commercial uses. All fossil fuels combined have fallen to almost zero as a source of electricity at present, decreasing from the miniscule 2.5 percent of the electricity they supplied in 2013. Switzerland does not have a single gas power plant devoted full-time to electric power, and it closed its sole oil-powered plant (associated with a now-defunct refinery) in 1999.

If not Russia, what caused the shortfall in Swiss electric power? The answer: increasing electric power demand from Switzerland’s push to decarbonize transportation emissions, combined with greater reliance on intermittent solar power and the recent closure of some nuclear power plants after the Fukushima accident in Japan (and other nuclear closures in the works). In short, politically forced increases in electricity demand and politically required supply reductions are creating the electricity shortfall.

Switzerland’s obsession with cutting emissions—not inherent power supply weaknesses, Russia’s Ukraine invasion, or climate change—is threatening the Swiss people’s standard of living and their ability to travel when, where, and for whatever reason they want.

FRANCE RELUCTANTLY REEMBRACES COAL

The Associated Press is reporting that France, where nuclear power has long been the most significant source of electric power, is keeping a coal plant open beyond its planned date of closure and reopening a second coal-fueled power plant that was closed to much fanfare earlier this year.

France had been phasing out coal use for decades as its nuclear fleet grew, and hydropower is the second-largest source of electric power there. French President Emmanuel Macron had vowed to close all coal-burning plants in the country by the end of 2022, as part of the country’s effort to fight climate change.

With huge government subsidies and power purchase mandates, wind and solar grew from providing almost no power to the electric grid in 2004 to approximately 8.4 percent today. Natural gas displaced coal as the largest source of fossil fuel generated power over the past three decades and is now the third largest source of power—which is fine as long as France has access to gas. France relied on Russia for much of its gas supply, however, so in the aftermath of the Ukraine invasion, France’s access to Russian gas has been compromised. Other countries that supply France with natural gas can’t take up the slack because of their own demand and limited spare pipeline and tanker/LNG terminal capacity.

The result, as reported by the Associated Press:

The end of France’s coal era seemed so certain last year that the operator of one of the country’s last coal-burning plants posted an upbeat educational video on YouTube titled “Let’s visit a coal plant that’s going to be destroyed!” The plant in the northeastern town of Saint-Avold indeed halted coal production as scheduled earlier this year—but not for long. This week, its workers were back at the controls, transporting coal from storage heaps and refiring furnaces, as part of emergency efforts to keep the heat and electricity on this winter. … Facing a worst-case scenario of rolling power cuts to households, the government issued a decree in September to allow Saint-Avold to start again and continued activity at another coal plant in western France, citing the “exceptional” and “unforeseeable” context of energy supply challenges.

Those involved in the restart and operation of the plant have called it a “necessary evil” for the medium term.

Macron has pushed to make France the global leader in fighting climate change, telling the U.S. Congress in a speech in 2018, “[W]e are killing our planet. Let us face it. There is no planet B.”

One question. If the state of the planet is so dire, why not just take the hit and tell the French people that living with less and at times no power is a “necessary evil” if they are to save the planet from a catastrophe caused by greenhouse gas emissions? France could have a “climate lockdown” like what it did two years ago with COVID.

That’s not the path Macron is taking. Hypocrisy is always rife in government. When push comes to shove, politicians realize people want their electric power, climate change be damned.

OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS HURT OCEAN LIFE

A recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications found offshore wind industrial facilities do previously unrecognized harm to marine ecosystems.

A team of scientists from various German research institutes and universities examined industrial wind projects in the North Sea, where the world’s largest offshore wind project is found.

Running multiple simulations through mathematical models, the scientists analyzed the “systematic, large-scale, time-integrated response of the ocean to large OWF [offshore wind farm] clusters,” concluding the “results provide evidence that the ongoing off shore wind farm developments can have a substantial impact on the structuring of coastal marine ecosystems on basin scales.”

The model simulations indicate the “wind wake” effect of OWFs (the effect turbines individually and collectively have on wind speeds, ocean currents, and sea life) could reduce annual primary productivity—the ability of microbial life, algae, phytoplankton, plants, and animals to obtain food and flourish—in the area encompassed by and beyond the wind farms by 10 percent or more. Less food for endangered whales and other ocean creatures is not a good thing.

The same modeling indicates OWFs slow ocean currents, resulting in less cycling of dissolved oxygen in affected areas and thereby reducing oxygen concentrations. Lower oxygen levels are bad for marine life.

Separately, these negative effects on the marine ecosystem in OWF areas indicate the OWFs will harm many species and disrupt ecosystem interconnections. Cumulatively, the harm will probably be much greater, including making it harder for endangered species such as the North Atlantic right whale to recover or even survive.

PRESS RELEASE: Public Interest Groups File Comments to Protect Endangered Right Whale from Offshore Virginia Wind Project,"H. Sterling Burnett, Jim Lakely","Noise from turbines will add to ship collisions that already have pushed the North Atlantic right whale to edge of extinction

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (December 8, 2022) – A coalition of public interest groups – The Heartland Institute, the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and the American Coalition for Ocean Protection (ACOP) – have filed comments with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to protect the endangered North Atlantic right whale.

In October, BOEM issued a document titled “North Atlantic Right Whale and Offshore Wind Strategy,” which is the agencies proposal to protect the whales – of which only about 300 remain in the North Atlantic – while also allowing a massive offshore wind power project off the East Coast. BOEM says the wind project is compatible with the federal government’s “zero kill” standard for the whales.

The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) – the sister agency to BOEM – issued an official opinion stating the North Atlantic right whale can only survive as a species if there are zero human-caused fatalities of the whale during any given year.

“The strategy and its approach to advancing offshore wind projects is doomed to failure,” said CFACT President Craig Rucker. “No amount of mitigation ordered by BOEM can assure that this massive wind industrialization envisioned for the East Coast will produce zero human killing of the right whale. The strategy is a pointless exercise and a waste of time and resources. Under these circumstances, it appears that litigation focused on Virginia Wind is inevitable.”

The coalition previously announced that it had retained as counsel the law firm of Gatzke, Dillon, and Ballance to represent it in evaluating the upcoming draft Environmental Impact Statement ((EIS) that BOEM will be producing for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Energy Project, managed and constructed by Dominion Energy of Virginia. The project would put thousands of wind turbines in the migratory path of the North Atlantic right whale.

Among the comments offered by the coalition regarding the BOEM strategy was documentation noting the massive 15-megawatt (MW) turbines proposed for the Virginia project – which would be the largest offshore wind system in the world – would generate noise levels far in excess of the 120-decibel level which National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has determined is the maximum safe operational level for underwater sound.

NOAA research has determined that even 10-MW turbines generate 180 decibels of underwater noise, which exceed safe limit by 50 percent.

“The operational noise of a project like Virginia Wind could create a 12,000 square mile circle of dangerous noise, which would almost certainly force the right whales out of their historic migration route and into one the busiest shipping lanes in the world,” said H. Sterling Burnett, Director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute. “Collision with ships is the greatest human cause of deaths to North Atlantic right whales, pushing the already endangered species into the paths of big ships is almost guaranteed to lead to more whale deaths and perhaps extinction.”

“It is inconceivable that the courts would find projects like Virginia Wind to be compatible with the mandates of the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, no matter how hard BOEM tries to dress up the offshore wind program with ‘mitigation measures,’” said ACOP President David Stevenson. “Zero kill means exactly what NMFS says it means. The species cannot withstand the risk of ship strikes and noise harassment inevitably resulting from the offshore wind program and projects like Virginia Wind.”

The coalition previously announced that it had retained as counsel the law firm of Gatzke, Dillon, and Ballance to represent it in evaluating the upcoming draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that BOEM will be producing for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Energy Project, managed and constructed by Dominion Energy of Virginia.

BOEM had previously announced that its “target date” for issuance of the Draft EiS was Aug. 1, 2022, with the Final EIS scheduled for May 1, 2023. In lieu of publishing the Draft EIS for Virginia Wind, BOEM issued the “strategy document,” which outlines a series of investigations and research it will undertake regarding the right whale before moving forward with pending offshore wind developments on the East Coast.

The coalition will continue to follow closely the reports and research produced as a result of the Strategy, and will comment on the draft EIS for Virginia Wind when issued by BOEM.

Citizens of the Same World,Greg E. Walcher,"History students learn one of the most famous lines from inaugural addresses, that spoken by President Kennedy in 1961, which begins, “And so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you…” They rarely learn the next line, which was “My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do…”

Ancient Greek philosopher Diogenes originated the ever-controversial concept of global citizenship, as opposed to citizenship in a particular country. Dictionaries define it as “the idea that one’s identity transcends geography or political borders.” A formal organization called “Citizens of World” opines that “We, as human beings, are members of one extended family. We are sons and daughters of one common creator: Mother Nature, sharing a common living place: the Earth, and have a common religion: Humanity.”

Obviously, not everyone shares that view of “citizenship,” but it is commonly used in politics. It does not necessarily suggest renouncing one’s own nationality, but acknowledging that individual identities take second place behind everyone’s membership in a global community.

The idea of our responsibility to the whole Earth has been a common catch phrase among practitioners of pop environmentalism for decades. Yet several recent issues prompt me to wonder whether many in the environmental lobby really believe it.

It is not difficult to identify several complex issues for which the preferred solution of these groups is to export the problem to other countries. New Zealand’s latest proposal to tax ranchers to the point of eliminating cattle comes to mind. When farmers protested that they cannot survive the new cow tax, the government responded by suggesting that farmers should be able to recoup the cost by charging more for “climate-friendly products.” What products would those be? Vegetables grown without the use of tractors? Certainly not beef, so New Zealanders would have two choices: stop eating meat, or import it at higher cost. Proponents don’t care whether ranchers raise cattle in Australia; they just don’t want to look at them in New Zealand. What a model of global citizenship.

Atop the list of such hypocrisy is the Biden Administration’s all-out program to stop the production of oil, gas, and coal – not everywhere, just in the United States. Just last month on the

campaign trail he repeated his “no more drilling” policy. Yet faced with high gas prices, skyrocketing home heating costs, and the worst inflation in 40 years, President Biden has requested, even demanded, increased production in other countries.

One result is an unconscionable increase in oil imported from Saudi Arabia and other nations – now $700 billion worth annually. Nor have American leaders done anything to combat China’s massive increase in coal production, now topping four billion metric tons a year. While the U.S. government touts its commitment to be carbon free by 2050, China mouthed a similar goal, but only by 2060, and is still pursuing policies and activities that betray a complete disregard of that “commitment.” China is financing nearly 700 new coal-fired power plants all over the world, including 43 in China itself. India is opening 67 new coal mines and building the world largest coal-fired power plants, while the U.S. abandons its own coal industry. That anti-coal policy does nothing to curb global emissions, so long as the planet’s two most populous countries ignore the issue. It merely disadvantages America.

Aren’t we all citizens of the same global community? We are frequently reminded that the entire world shares the same atmosphere, but it is also true that we share the same orb of land and water. The Earth is a giant fireball of energy, and it is no more harmed by drilling into it from one spot than another. One commentator put it more bluntly, saying “Saudi Arabia is drilling into the same planet we’re drilling into.” Indeed, and emissions from Saudi oil or Chinese coal go into the same atmosphere as any from the U.S.

The crux of it is that many politicians are sanctimoniously exporting America’s environmental problems to other countries. Then, they claim to be “solving” a global problem, when all they are really doing is kneecapping their own economy.

The popular phrase is “Think globally, act locally.” In other words, pretend you care about pollution in the Middle and Far East, by choking industries and jobs in your own community. Here’s a better approach: if we’re going to act locally, we should think locally, about the impact of such decisions on our own neighbors and communities.","December 8, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/citizens-of-the-same-world/
"Reduce, Reuse, Recover, and Recycle",Greg E. Walcher,"Plastic is a relatively new product, though it is used everywhere and in almost everything. It started with Bakelite, invented by Leo Baekeland in 1907 and used for electric insulators like distributor caps and light switches, and in molded products like cigarette holders and the original black telephones. By about 1950 improvements in the chemical process made plastic cheaper to mass produce, and virtually every major industry, and consumers, fell in love with it. The growth has been phenomenal and has never slowed. By 1960, 390 thousand tons of plastic were being produced annually, and today 380 million tons. It is used in every corner of the world – usually only once.

Last month regular listeners of All Things Considered on National Public Radio were treated to an in-depth story about the tragedy of recycling, namely, that it isn’t working. The story reached the ominous conclusion that “Recycling plastic is practically impossible — and the problem is getting worse.”

That may sound astonishing, because the Internet is filled with hundreds of articles and videos asserting that “most plastics can be recycled and reused again and again.” Sadly, that just isn’t true. The vast majority is not recycled, and much of it cannot be. We have been told to recycle plastic for decades, and recycling has become a badge of good citizenship for millions. The EPA has simple advice on how to handle the explosion of plastics, “Reduce, Reuse, Recover, and Recycle.” Sounds great.

Almost every significant population center in America has recycling processes built into their waste disposal systems, many actually requiring it. That began in 1989 with a California law requiring waste management agencies to divert 25 percent of solid waste to recycling facilities by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000. The goal has since been raised to 75 percent, though California has never come close to meeting the goal – nor has any other state. Twenty-five states now have mandatory recycling, as do dozens of cities. But what do their recycling facilities do with the mountains of plastic they receive? They send most of it to the landfills.

Officials estimate that plastic straws take 200 years to degrade and water bottles 450 years, and Solo cups over 500 years. These were all invented in my lifetime so I’m not sure how they know that, but either way plastics are obviously a disposal problem.

The main problem is that there are many kinds of plastics and because they have different chemical compositions, they cannot simply be melted together like aluminum or steel. Clear plastic water bottles (called PET) are different than opaque milk jugs (called HDPE). At least three types (PVC, polystyrene, and polycarbonate) are not recyclable at all. Polypropylene, from which much packaging is made, can be recycled, but at much higher cost than making it new. Plastic grocery

bags are easy to recycle, but new ones are so cheap to make that there is no market for recycled bags, so most municipalities won’t accept them in recycle bins.

Plastic bags are now banned in California and Hawaii, and in cities from Seattle to Nantucket. In Colorado, Crested Butte, Avon, Nederland, Breckenridge, Boulder, Aspen, Carbondale, and Telluride either ban or tax plastic bags. Consumers are expected not only to sort out recyclables, but now to sort different kinds of plastic. Most

consumers don’t. The result is an enormously expensive and labor intense sorting process at the recycle facility, which many jurisdictions just cannot afford. So, while consumers think they are recycling, much of the waste is headed to the same landfill as the regular trash.

A new Greenpeace paper scolds that the amount of plastic being turned into new products has fallen, now barely 5 percent nationwide. A Greenpeace activist says, “The crisis just gets worse and worse, and without drastic change will continue to worsen as the industry plans to triple plastic production by 2050.” How awful. “The industry” is a great boogey-man but could only contemplate such production if there is a good market for it. What must we do?

Much of the nation has followed California’s lead on this for years, so what is California doing? Blaming oil companies. Remember a couple years ago a group of state attorneys general tried to sue oil companies for climate change, claiming executives knew their products were destroying the planet but tried to cover it up. That legal theory, using racketeering laws, worked against tobacco companies in the 1980s, and now it has a new iteration. California Attorney General Rob Bonta is investigating oil companies, claiming they always knew plastics were not recyclable, and deceived the public into buying more by claiming it could be recycled.

“For more than half a century, the plastics industry has engaged in an aggressive campaign to deceive the public, perpetuating a myth that recycling can solve the plastics crisis,” Bonta said. “The truth is: The vast majority of plastic cannot be recycled.”

That is rich, since his State not only started a national recycling frenzy, but perpetuated it through strong laws, right up to this day. As the public is just beginning to realize how little plastic is recycled, even in California, no wonder officials there want someone else to blame.

Government officials never consider their own complicity in policies that make matters worse. For example, Denver area collectors will pick up leaves and grass clippings, which are 100 percent biodegradable – but only if they’re in plastic bags, which are not.

As the NPR story asked, after decades of supporting plastic recycling, must we just consider it trash like any other, or are there better choices? Personally, I don’t require government intervention. I just prefer glass, wood, paper, stone, leather, cotton, and wool. That’s my choice, not the mayor’s.","December 3, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/reduce-reuse-recover-and-recycle/
Economic Realities Dash Biden’s Offshore Wind Plans,H. Sterling Burnett,"President Joe Biden’s plans for offshore industrial wind facilities lining the nation’s coasts have more than a few hurdles to clear before they can become reality.

As part of his plan to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, Biden has initiated efforts build 30,000 megawatts of traditional offshore wind facilities (with structures attached to the ocean floor) in federal waters by 2030, and an additional 15,000 megawatts of floating industrial offshore wind by 2035. To hit those targets, the Biden administration is pushing to lease areas in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of Maine and off the coasts of New England, the Mid-Atlantic States, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, and Oregon.

Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, whose department has regulatory control over the U.S. outer continental shelf, discussed the plan at a wind industry gathering in Boston in 2021.

“The Interior Department is laying out an ambitious road map as we advance the administration’s plans to confront climate change, create good-paying jobs, and accelerate the nation’s transition to a cleaner energy future,” Haaland said.

As Haaland made clear, the Biden administration’s offshore wind efforts are about more than fighting climate change. They also amount to a federally financed jobs program with hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars being shoveled into boosting so-called green energy and transportation projects. Think of it as the climate change equivalent of President Franklin Roosevelt’s Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps and as Biden’s backdoor Green New Deal.

The problem is Biden’s green energy dream is a nightmare for consumers, who will get hit with much higher energy prices.

Fortunately, economic problems created by provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) may erect insurmountable hurdles to Biden’s green dream of giant wind turbines marring the ocean-scapes from sea to shining sea.

Before we get into the economic problems that are entangling various proposed wind projects, let’s talk about the economics that should have ensured none of the proposed offshore industrial wind facilities ever reached the permitting stage.

Offshore wind is absolutely the most expensive source of electric power being considered anywhere, and it is among the most unreliable. The heavy reliance on offshore wind facilities for electricity is one reason why the U.K. now has the highest electric power prices in the world. Unlike markets, where price hikes almost always ensure supplies increase to meet demand and thus ultimately reduce prices, wind power is not dependent on incentives but on nature. Despite high prices, the U.K. and other European nations suffered energy shortages when winds over the North Sea went calm during the summer and left turbines dead in the water for days or weeks at a time.

Let’s talk about the comparative cost. Before generous federal tax credits and other federal and state support, the levelized cost of electricity from new offshore wind is $136.51 per megawatt hour (Mwh), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Even if new gas pipelines had to be constructed, natural gas could provide energy in place of Biden’s offshore wind monstrosities for a fraction of that cost. In addition, jobs from natural gas production and use don’t have to be subsidized by taxpayers, because those companies do not rely on government support for continued operation: they make profits and pay taxes instead of consuming them.

If you reject natural gas out of hand because it produces greenhouse gases at the point of generation, either solar at $36.49/Mwh before tax credits or onshore wind at $40.23/Mwh would be a much better deal for taxpayers and ratepayers than offshore wind.

Offshore industrial wind facilities are nothing more than big virtue-signaling boondoggles—a windfall for the politically connected companies that build and operate them.

Or they would be, if reality didn’t raise its ugly head. To wit:

“Plans for massive offshore wind farms that President Joe Biden hopes will power as many as 10 million American homes by 2030 are starting to wobble,” Bloomberg recently reported. The New Jersey utility Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), which owns 25 percent of Ocean Wind 1, proposed to be the largest offshore wind facility off the coast of New Jersey, is considering pulling out the project. Ocean Wind I is expected to deploy 98 gigantic 12-megawatt turbines, towering 900 feet above mean low water level at their blade tips, and would be located 13 miles offshore from Atlantic City. If operational and functioning as designed, it would generate 1.1 gigawatts, enough for 500,000 homes.

The problem for PSEG is that material and labor costs are rising and supply chain shortages persist in delaying construction. These problems are not unique to Ocean Wind I. Bloomberg noted in mid-October, “New England utility Avangrid Inc. said its similarly sized Commonwealth Wind project was no longer viable because of higher costs and supply chain woes.”

“‘Global commodity price increases, in part due to ongoing war in Ukraine, sharp and sudden increases in interest rates, prolonged supply chain constraints, and persistent inflation have significantly increased the expected cost of constructing the project,’ [Avangrid’s] attorneys said in the filing,” Bloomberg reports. These problems have forced Avangrid to ask state regulators to pause their review of its contract so the company can reevaluate the timeline and cost estimates.

Further complicating Biden’s grandiose offshore wind plans are provisions in the recently enacted and grossly misnamed Inflation Reduction Act. Although the IRA subsidies for green energy technologies such as offshore wind are lavish, they come with labor-union-favoring strings attached, which will almost certainly prevent many projects from coming to fruition.

I have written previously about the how the “Buy American” and prevailing wage provisions in the IRA are likely to make its goals for electric vehicle use impossible. The auto industry notes the provisions requiring the materials used to construct and power electric cars be produced and/or manufactured in America will make it virtually impossible to replace all gasoline-powered vehicles in the time demanded. Those minerals and materials are not mined, refined, or assembled in America, and there is no evidence environmental laws currently preventing their domestic development and manufacture will be changed soon. Mines opened in 2030, 2035, or beyond won’t get electric vehicles manufactured or sold today.

Those provisions or similar ones apply to offshore wind developers applying for federal loans, subsidies, and tax credits.

Tax credit bonuses are awarded only for offshore wind projects that pay their workers “prevailing” union wages, meaning they cannot use low-cost contractors. More importantly, the IRA has a domestic-content requirement for the components used in every facet of a large wind operation. Nacelles, turbines, batteries, wires, and other items must have at least 40 percent domestically produced content if construction begins before 2025, and 55 percent if construction begins after 2026. There is absolutely no evidence these “Buy America” standards can be met by any industrial offshore wind project currently in the construction or permitting stage.

In fact, the provisions are likely to wind up before an international tribunal because our European allies and probably the Chinese, who would be affected the most by the domestic content requirements, will want to challenge them as unfair trade practices under various trade agreements.

As a matter of economics, the large-scale, rapid approval of offshore wind projects makes no sense when compared to any other possible source of electric power. As a matter or energy security, Biden’s plan is downright dangerous: it would subject large areas of the United States to unpredictable periodic power outages. Fortunately, as a practical matter the provisions in the IRA intended to get labor unions to support it are likely to foil many if not all of Biden’s grand schemes for offshore wind. At least we had better hope they do.

GLACIER NATIONAL PARK SHOWS NO ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE DECLINE … UHI BIASES CANADIAN TEMPERATURE DATA

GLACIER NATIONAL PARK SHOWS NO ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE DECLINE

The decline of Glacier National Park’s glaciers is commonly attributed to anthropogenic climate change, but research indicates glaciers wax and wane in response to natural cycles and the recent glacial decline began long before humans began putting significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimates glacier cover in Glacier National Park declined by approximately 70 percent between 1850 and 2015. Melting began at the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in 1850. Surveys began only in the 1880s, but the evidence suggests the glaciers were in retreat before then and had been expanding during the LIA before that.

Discussing Glacier National Park’s history, Judith Curry, Ph.D. explains,

Looking … back, Glacier National Park was virtually ice free 11,000 years ago. Glaciers have been present within the boundaries of present-day Glacier National Park since about 6,500 years ago. [link] These glaciers have varied in size, tracking climatic variations, but did not grow to their recent maximum size until the end of the Little Ice Age, around 1850. An 80-year period (~1770-1840) of cool, wet summers and above-average winter snowfall led to a rapid growth of glaciers just prior to the end of the Little Ice Age. So, the recent loss of glacier mass must be understood in light of the fact the glaciers reached their largest mass for the past 11,000 years during the 19th century.

More recently, data in a 2017 USGS report show glaciers in the park declined by approximately 50 percent from the end of the LIA to 1966, the equivalent of a 4.5 percent loss per decade. The decline slowed between 1966 and 1988, to about 3.7 percent per decade, a 12 percent decrease. Between 1998 and 2015, the glacier loss slowed further, averaging a loss of 2.8 percent per decade. This USGS report clearly shows glaciers in the park were declining much more rapidly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when human carbon dioxide emissions were negligible, than they have been during the recent period of rapid increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

Since 2015 it appears the glacial retreat may have halted entirely, Curry notes, with some evidence suggesting seven consecutive years of normal to above-normal snowpack and multiyear instances of “exceptionally cold outbreak[s]” have resulted in a modest increase in glacier cover.

The evidence strongly suggests nature, not human activities, drives glacial expansion and contraction in Glacier National Park.

UHI BIASES CANADIAN TEMPERATURE DATA

Roy Spencer, Ph.D., principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, has found the urban heat island (UHI) effect biases the reported temperature data in Canadian cities.

On comparing rural temperature monitoring sites across Canada with urban ones for the summers of 1978 through 2022, Spencer found a significant average nighttime warm bias in urban areas, plus a weaker daytime effect. When the ground-based temperature data was compared to the temperatures recorded by the Landsat satellite system, Spencer discovered an overall “hot” bias of as much as 20 percent for the two cities, with as much as a 50 percent nighttime bias in Calgary.

Spencer found techniques used to adjust for bias in temperature data performed poorly for urban areas:

Current “homogenization” techniques for thermometer data adjustment do not explicitly attempt to correct urban trends to match rural trends, although I would expect that they do perform this function if most of the stations are rural. Instead, they amount to statistical “consensus-building” exercises where the majority wins. So, if most of the stations are affected by increasing UHI effects, to varying degrees, these are not forced to match the rural stations. Instead, the reverse occurs. For example, in the U.S. the Watts et al. analysis of station data showed that the U.S. homogenized dataset (USHCN) produced temperature trends as large as those produced by the stations with the worst siting in terms of spurious heat sources. They further found that use of only well-sited thermometer locations leads to substantial reductions in temperature trends compared to the widely used homogenized dataset.

Spencer compared temperature data from 70 ground-based systems with Landsat data to determine how the UHI affects 10 urbanized areas in Canada. The results are shown in Table 1:

Based on this comparison, Spencer concludes,

Canadian cities show a substantial urban heat island effect in the summer, especially at night, and Landsat-based estimates of increased urbanization suggest that this has caused a spurious warming component of reported temperature trends, at least for locations experiencing increased urbanization. … The issue is important because rational energy policy should be based upon reality, not perception. To the extent that global warming estimates are exaggerated, so will be energy policy decisions.

Save America’s Grid!,David Wojick,"It is no secret that America’s electric power grid is becoming unreliable. The secret is whose fault it is. Not knowing who to blame makes it hard to fix.

If I could get a show of hands I bet that almost no one has heard of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. They are called NERC which rhymes with jerk. They are a private corporation endowed with federal authority to keep America’s lights on. NERC makes and enforces the regulations governing grid reliability in America. The looming threat of numerous blackouts is their fault. They have obviously failed to maintain reliability, which is their specific mission.

The grid is sick and getting sicker.

The reason for this growing unreliability is well established. It is the mad rush to replace reliable coals and nuclear power plants with weather dependent wind and solar power. This simply does not work and we are beginning to pay the price of folly. We must constrain and manage the penetration of renewables to maintain reliability. Given that battery costs are impossibly large, even assuming fantastic cost reductions, powering the grid with wind and solar is itself impossible. Reliability requires sufficient backup generation.

Last spring NERC released a major report warning of likely blackouts across much of America in summer 2022, and for the foreseeable future thereafter. This fall they warned us of possible coming winter blackouts.

My question is, instead of reporting this pending calamity, why is NERC not preventing it? What is not reported, and seems to be little known, is that NERC is a quasi-regulatory federal agency whose mission is to maintain reliability. Clearly NERC is failing.

NERC issues reliability standards which the electric power industry is supposed to follow. These federal standards are supposed to be enforced by NERC’s regional subsidiaries. Clearly this process has not worked or we would not be facing widespread blackouts. Why not?

By way of background, NERC was originally a Council, not a Corporation. It was formed in 1968 as a voluntary industry body after the massive 1960’s Eastern blackout. It became a corporation when it was “federalized” around 2006. It answers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the US, but also includes Canada. NERC creates and enforces Reliability Standards with both countries.

Here is NERC’s mission statement: “The vision for the Electric Reliability Organization Enterprise, which is comprised of NERC and the six Regional Entities, is a highly reliable and secure North American bulk power system. Our mission is to assure the effective and efficient reduction of risks to the reliability and security of the grid.​“

This vision is clearly inconsistent with NERC’s warning that widespread blackouts loom large for America.

Here is what NERC says about its Reliability Standards: “NERC’s Standards program ensures the reliability of the bulk power system by developing quality reliability standards in a timely manner that are effective, clear, consistent and technically sound.”

If the NERC standard program supposedly “ensures the reliability” of the grid then clearly their standards are inadequate. NERC simply does not address this massive issue.

Unreliability is reported to already be getting pretty bad. Sustained outages in the U.S. went from less than 12 in 2000 to over 180 in 2020. The average utility customer went from 8 hours of power failure per year in 2013 to 16 in 2020. Since then we have had the disastrous Texas blackout and numerous smaller warnings and losses.

Looking ahead it gets much worse. The Biden Administration’s stated goal is for the electric power system to produce zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2035, a mere 13 years away. That means shutting down all fossil fueled generation, which presently provides more than half of America’s electricity.

Meeting the incredible Biden Federal Plan target is clearly a great threat to reliability. Given that this goal was announced well over a year ago, NERC should already have developed standards to protect reliability during this called for transition. Either that or NERC should say that eliminating fossil fuels in 13 years simply cannot be done reliably. I find no indication that NERC or any of its Regional Entities is even looking at this staggering scenario. The studies I have seen are limited to around 50% renewables and even these are not leading to standards.

Moreover, many utilities are posting generation plans that are clearly unreliable, swapping fossil fueled and nuclear plants for wind and solar with very little of the required storage. NERC should be blowing the whistle on these massively unreliable plans. NERC is clearly failing to meet its mission.

NERC is funded by a tax on utility electric power sales. Thus it is paid by the very entities it regulates, which sounds like a very bad plan. Its rulemaking is also largely done by committees, which are dominated by the regulated utilities. This dependence on the utilities may well explain why NERC has never exposed the recklessly unreliable utility behavior that led to the present precarious grid. One might say that not only is the utility fox in the reliability chicken house, the fox is running and funding it.

There are 93 NERC Reliability Standards. None has anything to do with controlling the adverse impact of renewables upon reliability. Reliability must be restored and maintained. NERC has the authority to develop proposed Reliability Standards to constrain and manage the growth of renewables.

If NERC will not act then FERC has in the past ordered NERC to draft specific Reliability Standards. Awhile back they ordered an entire set of Standards for cyber security. This sort of Order may be just what is needed to constrain the presently reckless transition from reliable fossil fueled generation to intermittent, weather dependent wind and solar power.

Alternatively, if NERC and FERC fail to act then Congress should mandate that they do so. Bills have been introduced in the past directing FERC and NERC to develop specific standards, so this would not be unprecedented.

COP 27 Has No Back-up Plan to Replace Products from Oil!,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The U.N. COP27 conference was held in Egypt and attracted the global elites and more than four hundred private jets. All attendees recognize that the climate change is occurring, like is has for four billion years, but it seems that most lacked basic energy literacy that starts with the knowledge that renewable energy is only intermittent electricity generated from unreliable breezes and sunshine, as wind turbines and solar panels that cannot manufacture anything for the 8 billion on this planet.

The indisputable unpleasant facts are that renewables, like wind turbines and solar panels, CANNOT manufacture any of the oil derivatives that are the basis of the thousands of products that are the foundation of societies and economies around the world.

Fossil fuel products were the reasons the world populated from 1 to 8 billion in less than two hundred years. As much as world leaders wish to rid the world of emissions from fossil fuels, the world has yet to identify the replacement for the oil derivatives that are the basis of more than 6,000 products and fuels for our various transportation infrastructures.

COP attendees should also know that crude oil is useless unless it can be manufactured into something usable like the fuels for the heavy-weight and long-range transportation infrastructures of ships and jets and the derivatives that make the more than 6,000 products and fuels that have made our lives more comfortable.

Today we have 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range merchant ships that are moving products throughout the world.

Today we have 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range jets used by commercial airlines, private usage, and the military.

The World Economic Forum (WEF), the UN and their Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and banks that promote ESG, are an extremely dangerous precedent as the eight billion people on this planet never voted to give governments this sort of control over the products demanded by the eight billion on this planet.

COP27 attendees wishing to achieve zero emissions at virtually any cost, will face major supply chain issues of those exotic materials like lithium, cobalt, copper, zinc, and silicon, as well as the challenge of affordability. In addition, the availability and affordability of electricity from breezes and sunshine, and the ethical challenges from the mining of exotic materials that are exploiting folks in poorer countries, just for the elites to drive an EV.

The supply of lithium for current EV batteries is already extremely limited in the world and initiatives around the world to open lithium strip mines and ore processing plants have caused a public uproar as environmentalists and the local population are fearful about the impact on nature and people’s livelihoods.

A few other darks clouds on the lithium supply to meet demands of EV batteries:

The Chilean Supreme Court stopped the mining of lithium in Salarf de Atacama, Chile – a huge chunk of terrain that holds 55 percent of the world’s known deposits of lithium. The European Chemicals Agency’s (ECHA) risk assessment committee is aiming at labelling three lithium compounds as dangerous for human health.

Before the U.N. jumps out of an airplane without a tested parachute, the U.N. needs to have a plan to be able to support the demands of the eight billion on this globe for all the products and infrastructures that exist today that did not exist a few hundred years ago. Where is the U.N. plan to keep the planet’s eight billion alive and well with the products now being manufactured from crude oil?

Efforts to cease the use of crude oil, without a planned replacement, could be the greatest threat to civilization’s eight billion, not climate change, and lead the world to an era of guaranteed extreme shortages of fossil fuel products like we had in the decarbonized world in the 1800’s, which may result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths trying to live without the fossil fuels that are benefiting society.

It’s perfect nonsense that functional, civil societies can live without coal, oil and gas. Today’s life without fossil fuels is symptomatic of an uneducated cohort who haven’t the faintest idea about what makes their safe and utterly privileged little lives possible.

Those clean renewables, like wind turbines and solar panels, can only generate ELECTRICITY, and intermittent electricity at best from available breezes and sunshine.

Electricity from wind and solar CAN:

Can charge your iPhone, but cannot make your iPhone

Can operate a defibrillator but cannot make the defibrillator.

Can operate your TV but cannot make the TV.

Electricity from wind and solar CANNOT:

Cannot make tires for the billions of vehicles.

Cannot make asphalt for the millions of miles of roadways.

Cannot make medications and medical equipment.

Cannot make water filtration systems.

Cannot make sanitation systems.

Cannot make fertilizers that come from natural gas to help feed billions.

Cannot make pesticides to control locusts and other pests.

Getting down to basics, even all the components of wind turbines and solar panels are all made with products from fossil fuels. Thus, eliminating fossil fuels, would eliminate all the components of wind turbines, solar panels, vehicles, merchant ships, jets, and more. Again, where is the U.N. plan to keep the planet’s eight billion alive and well with the products now being manufactured from crude oil?

Life Without Oil is NOT AS SIMPLE AS the U.N. MAY THINK as renewable energy is only intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine as NEITHER wind turbines nor solar panels can manufacture anything for society. Climate change may impact humanity but being mandated to live without the products manufactured from oil will necessitate lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s.

World leaders and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) movement leaders that are setting policies to rid the world of fossil fuels seem to forget that poor nations should also have inalienable, God-given rights to develop, using fossil fuel, nuclear and hydroelectric power – and petroleum as feed stocks for fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, plastics and hundreds of other miraculous life-enhancing, life-saving products.","November 29, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/cop-27-has-no-back-up-plan-to-replace-products-from-oil/
COP27 — The “Loss and Damage” Camel’s Nose is Very Fuzzy,David Wojick,"The loss and damage camel’s nose is so fuzzy at this point there may not even be a camel. Nothing has been agreed to except that a Transitional Committee will consider what might be agreed to.

But it could be great fun to watch. The developing countries fighting over nothing. China refusing to pay. Be still my heart. Okay do not be still.

The original deal was finally kept at the end, which is no surprise, endless loud green voices to the contrary notwithstanding. Liability for climate damage was not mentioned in the final agreement and any decision on a specific fund was put off until later (if ever).

Of course the press still talks about reparations and compensation but those loaded liability terms will never appear in the official UN descriptions. This is the studied vagueness of diplomacy. Recipients can call it compensation while donors call it foreign aid.

The press also insists on saying the “details” still have to be worked out. The reality is that the essential features are all still in limbo, with possibly devastating fights looming. Here is a quick look at some likely controversies.

On the donor side the biggest issue is whether China should pay. This has been brewing for some time and is now ready to serve. After all, China is the second biggest economy and the biggest emitter by far, burning an incredible four billion tons of coal a year. Actually that makes sense since they are the world’s industrial base. But it bothers the climate alarmists no end.

China’s consistent response is that we are not renegotiating the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which holds China to be a developing country. Others argue that is exactly what we should be doing, with the evergreen Washington Post taking a lead here. WashPo says China is now 34 times richer than in 1992, with four times the emissions.

In fact for some time now the UN dialogs have used the telling term “developing countries, excluding China” to refer to the said-to-be developing world. (I like to think that America is still developing.) So China is already de facto not a developing country is some cases.

This tangle quickly gets much thornier because China is not the only developing country to do well since 1992. The list is actually pretty long, perhaps led by Saudi Arabia and Singapore. Such a list may well emerge as the fund talks proceed.

On the recipient side it is if anything more complex. The “loss and damage” agreement merely says the “particularly vulnerable countries” get the money, where this means vulnerable to supposed damage from human caused climate change.

The looming problem is that there are at least three very different possible criteria for particularly vulnerable and these differences give the money to different countries. This could well be the biggest fight of all, even crippling. And each criterion was well represented in the force that pushed this agreement through the gate.

First there are the “least developed states” which is UN speak for really poor countries. These countries have the least means for dealing with major damages, so in that sense they are clearly particularly vulnerable.

Then there are the low lying island countries. They claim to be in danger of being wiped out by sea level rise. Extermination is as vulnerable as it gets, right?

But then there are the countries with the biggest losses. References to Pakistan’s 40+ billion dollar flood made it the battle flag for the successful “loss and damage” charge.

Here we come full circle because China may hold the record for flood damages, especially for loss of life. Their 1931 flood is estimated to have caused two million deaths, with 150,000 directly from drowning and the rest indirectly such as from the resulting famine.

Clearly it is far from clear which countries are particularly vulnerable, under the doctrine of human caused damages.

In summary, both who pays and who gets are potentially highly controversial within the developing world. That the Transitional Committee will come to agreement on any of these fuzzy issues seems unlikely and that is not necessarily their charter. More likely they will articulate the issue and drop them into the lap of COP28 next year.

But first the Committee has to be formed and even that may not be easy. Of the 24 member countries, 14 will be developing countries and which countries these are may make a big difference, given the different sorts of vulnerability. The member specifications are mostly geographic, except two are from small islands and two from least developed states.

See last page here: http://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/COP-27-Loss-and-Damage-11-20-22-DRAFT.pdf

Then at COP28 the fun will really begin because every one of the 200+ countries attending has a veto. This debate could go on forever. In the meantime there is no actual “loss and damage” fund.

Stay tuned to CFACT as this potentially hilarious (and endless) global drama unfolds, starting with forming the Transitional Committee.","November 29, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/cop27-the-loss-and-damage-camels-nose-is-very-fuzzy/
"California Moves to Get Rid of Fossil Fuel, What’s The Problem? California Insider Interviews Ronald Stein","Ronald Stein, P.E.","The video interview with the Epoch Times, Siyamak Khorrami, on the California Insider program, was a conversation about the elephant in the room that no one wants to talk about: the lack of energy literacy in the bizarre California energy policies.

The captivating and candid 35-minute video of the interview can be seen at:

Correction: When the conversation was addressing the probable closure of two large refineries in Northern California, I incorrectly stated that Marathon was one, but it is the PBF refinery at Martinez, recently purchased from Shell Oil, along with the Chevron refinery at Richmond.

The elephant in the room is the lack of products in the future, manufactured from the fossil fuels that built the world to 8 billion people, that the ruling class and the media refuse to talk about. Limiting the supply of the products manufactured from those fossil fuels will inflict shortages and inflation in perpetuity on current lifestyles.

California, like the rest of America, and the wealthy countries of the UK, Germany and Australia lack the knowledge that renewable energy is only intermittent electricity generated from unreliable breezes and sunshine, as wind turbines and solar panels cannot manufacture anything for the 8 billion on this planet.

"World Cup Stadiums and “Green” Exploitation of Cheap, Disposable Workforces","Ronald Stein, P.E.","The 2022 World Cup in Qatar kicked off on Sunday November 20 at the Al Bayt Stadium, but the “acceptable” toll on the cheap disposable workforce will provide viewers and participants with many lingering questions about our ethical and moral beliefs resulting from the grim toll of more than 6,500 migrant laborers who died between 2011 and 2020, many while helping build World Cup infrastructure including seven new stadiums. The low cost of stadium construction reflects the even lower cost of labor in Qatar.

Many of us had a chance to view the 2006 movie “Blood Diamonds” starring Leonardo DiCaprio that portrays many of the similar atrocities that took place in Qatar to build seven new stadiums for the 2022 World Cup, and continues occurring today in the developing countries that are mining for the “Blood Minerals” i.e., those exotic minerals and metals to support the “green” movement within wealthy countries.

Wealthy countries continue to silently support similar the exploitation of folks with yellow, brown, and black skin by supporting subsidies to procure EV’s and build more wind and solar when those subsidies are providing financial incentives to the developing countries mining for those “green” materials that promotes further exploitations of poor people in developing countries and environmental degradation to landscapes in “other” countries

Even President Biden’s expressed his recent shift on child labor when the Biden administration declared October 4, 2022, that batteries from China may be tainted by child labor, a move that could upend the electric vehicle industry while giving fresh ammunition to critics of White House climate policies.

The Department of Labor said it would add lithium-ion batteries to a list of goods made with materials known to be produced with child or forced labor under a 2006 human trafficking law. The decision was based on many batteries using cobalt, a mineral largely mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where children have been found to work at some mining sites.

The department released the list in the form of a report that excoriated “clean energy” supply chains for using forced labor. It grouped Chinese batteries together with polysilicon — a key material used in solar panel cells — made in the Chinese province of Xinjiang.

Biden’s 2022 declaration occurred one year after the book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy was nominated for a 2021 Pulitzer Prize. The book does an excellent job of discussing the lack of transparency to the world of the green movement’s impact upon humanity exploitations in the developing countries that are mining for the exotic minerals and metals required to create the batteries needed to store “green energy”. In these developing countries, these mining operations exploit child labor, and are responsible for the most egregious human rights’ violations of vulnerable minority populations. These operations are also directly destroying the planet through environmental degradation.

COP-27 Financiers and Merchants of Death,Paul Driessen,"As Americans give thanks this week for our many blessings, let us recall the Pilgrims’ and Native Americans’ primitive agricultural knowledge and technologies, the hunger and disease that were constants in their lives – and how so many around the world are not much better off today.

Much of Africa still lives on the edge, with well over 600 million people not even having electricity. Many parts of India, Asia and Latin America also face serious energy and food deprivation.

Incredibly, so does Europe. “German industry stares into the Net Zero abyss,” “Europe’s energy crisis may get even worse next year,” “Even Germany’s wind industry is sliding into crisis,” “Millions face poverty and destitution in Green Britain, as Brits pay highest electricity bills in world,” headlines warn.

Banning Russian gas imports amid Putin’s war on Ukraine plays a role and is frequently scapegoated. But the primary cause is Europe’s love affair with intermittent wind and solar, and hate-fest for fossil fuels and nuclear, amid frigid winter realities that have caused Germany to obliterate ancient villages and recent-vintage wind farms to mine lignite coal beneath them.

Closer to home, New England and New York also face a cold, dark winter, because they too have voted against drilling, fracking, pipelines, coal and nuclear power – and now demand more oil and gas from the same companies that they and President Biden want to drive into oblivion.

However, the greatest hypocrisy of all was on full-throated display at the COP-27 climate circus in Egypt November 6-18 – where attendees kept asking whether Africa should be allowed to exploit its oil, natural gas and coal reserves to improve living standards, feed families and save lives!

Al Gore preached that fossil fuel investments should be terminated worldwide, including in Africa. UN Secretary General António Guterres absurdly asserted that “New funding for fossil fuel exploration and production is delusional” and will only “feed the scourge of war, pollution and climate catastrophe” (the manmade cataclysms found in computer models and COP-27 rants, though not in the Real World).

At the COP-27 climate gabfest in Sham-El-Sheikhdown, Egypt, John Kerry said African nations shouldn’t rely on natural gas to generate electricity and modernize. (Kerry has five houses, a yacht and private jet – but that’s OK because they’re in his wife’s name, and he merely “makes use of them.”)

Even worse, it’s not just energy these arrogant eco-totalitarians want to obstruct in Africa and other developing regions. It’s also modern fertilizers — indeed, all aspects of modern agriculture – everything that can actually help farmers feed hungry people and make enough money to build a home or barn, send their children to school, and buy tractors and other equipment.

They don’t even want Africa producing natural gas and using it to make nitrogen fertilizer, which dramatically boosts crop yields and is absolutely essential if the world is to feed eight billion people – especially without turning millions more acres of wildlife habitat into marginal croplands.

Poor countries are no long going to tolerate this outrageous, intolerable, racist neo-colonialism. Nor should they, especially when they realize now-rich countries are on the verge of de-industrialization and bankruptcy – and have neither the intention nor ability to shell out billions, much less trillions, of dollars in annual “reparation, loss and damage” payments for alleged impacts from manmade climate change.

So when the UN, now-rich countries and eco-pressure groups tell them there’ll be no financing for fossil fuels and modern agriculture – only for wind and solar energy, organic farming and “AgroEcology” – poor countries should just tell these purveyors of poverty, hunger, disease and death to buzz off. That would leave poor countries largely on their own.

But they have numerous advantages that their predecessors lacked: access to the incredible energy, agricultural, industrial, economic, medical, communication and other advances of recent centuries, especially during the fossil-fueled industrial era.

They simply need to chart their own destinies and utilize these advances. Every project they undertake will generate new wealth, innovation and self-confidence to undertake subsequent projects.

I’ve written about these callous eco-imperialists – these financiers and merchants of death – many times (here, here, here and here, for example).

Unfortunately, they never repent, never revise their lethal attitudes and policies. The global following they enjoy underscores how the ill-informed but well-intended really are led around by the well-informed but ill-intended – on climate, energy, agriculture and human rights.

Their AgroEcology schemes reject virtually the entire foundation of modern agriculture, which feeds feed billions of people with less acreage and water, using monoculture farming, carefully developed and tested chemical fertilizers and insecticides, biotechnology, hybrid seeds and mechanized equipment.

Instead, they demand “food sovereignty” – the “right” to “culturally appropriate” food produced through “ecologically sound and sustainable methods, in accord with AgroEcology policies – the kind that brought hunger and chaos to Sri Lanka.

They even vilify Golden Rice, which could end Vitamin A Deficiency, blindness and death among malnourished children.

Could the insanity and hypocrisy get any worse? Sadly – yes.

European leaders have been pleading with African nations to launch oil, gas and coal projects – for shipment to Europe. In their next breath, the EU Commission says supporting nitrogen fertilizer production in Africa would “clash” with EU climate goals.

The International Energy Agency worries that half of Sub-Saharan Africa’s population has no access to electricity. In its next breath, the IEA says stopping planetary overheating doesn’t allow for more African petroleum production.

Even more colonialist, Time magazine promotes the notion that “humans eating insects could help save the planet.” The New York Times extolls a new Julia Child “Joy of Cooking (Insects).” And a group of “renowned” African and European “ecology and nutrition experts” says climate change and other considerations make Africa “the perfect laboratory” for testing new ways to feed humanity – like turning lake flies from the Lake Victoria region into “crackers, muffins, meat loaves and sausages.”

COP-27 (or FLOP-27) claims to have reached another “historic milestone” in saving Planet Earth! But it’s all driven by unfounded hysteria about manmade climate cataclysms. Let’s all take a deep breath.

We certainly face climate fluctuations and extreme weather events – but no worse than in the past, and with no replicable, convincing evidence that manmade emissions have replaced natural forces. More importantly, we have far greater wealth, far more knowledge, far better technologies and resources than in the past – to help us adapt to climate changes, survive extreme weather events and rebuild afterward.

That’s infinitely preferable to blanketing the Earth with wind turbines, solar panels, battery modules, transmission lines, mines and factories to build the things – and processing plants to make bug burgers and other delicacies, in time for climate luminaries to enjoy them at COP-28.

Can’t we just be calm and rational (and thus colonialist?) just this once? Just asking.","November 22, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/cop-27-financiers-and-merchants-of-death/
Climate Catastrophism Is Worse Than Climate Change,H. Sterling Burnett,"Earlier this week I noticed an editorial in the Colorado Springs Gazette describing the harm being caused by “climate change catastrophism,” which I think of as climate alarmists’ equivalent of the Chinese water torture: mainstream media platforms’ daily drip, drip, drip of demonstrably false or grossly exaggerated claims about potential harms from climate change. My colleague Linnea Lueken, a research fellow with The Heartland Institute’s Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy, wrote about the editorial for Climate Realism after I brought it to her attention.

Essentially the editorial and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) article on which it is based make a critical point, as the Colorado Springs Gazette states: “Enough with climate-change scare tactics. They hurt people, possibly more than they will suffer from climate change.”

This truth echoes what we have said repeatedly at Climate Realism, Climate at a Glance, and Climate Change Weekly: the data does not support claims that extreme weather events are becoming more severe or more frequent. Policies to prevent a climate disaster that will never arrive are likely to produce worse harms than climate change itself. Prominent authors made the same points in three bestselling books released in the past couple of years: False Alarm, by Bjorn Lomborg, Ph.D.; Unsettled, by Steven Koonin, Ph.D.; and Apocalypse Never, by Michael Shellenberger.

In the meantime, these claims are doing untold damage. Children’s psyches are being horribly scarred as climate catastrophism has created whole new category of psychological disorder, “climate grief,” generated by fearmongering politicians, activists, and the mainstream media. This condition has spawned a new area of psychological practice: “ecopsychology.” Meanwhile, slavery, child labor, and environmental destruction are the foundations of the green energy technologies being pushed to replace fossil fuels to prevent climate disaster.

The Colorado Springs Gazette sums up the PNAS article thus:

In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists warn of too much focus by the scientific community on unlikely worst-case scenarios—including imminent extinction of human life—rather than more plausible outcomes that fall between Armageddon on one extreme and “no worries” on the other. Alarmism, they explain, leads to impossible goals of ending all fossil fuel consumption by mid-century, social disarray, and mental health problems.

Specifically a team of three international researchers wrote in the peer-reviewed PNAS,

[H]istory also shows risks in overemphasizing the likelihood of calamity. Mindful of this, we argue Kemp et al. understate the degree to which recent scientific and public discourses already prioritize catastrophic climate scenarios. … Simultaneously, IPCC reports also overemphasize catastrophic scenarios, as does broader discourse. … Overemphasized apocalyptic futures can be used to support despotism and rashness. For example, catastrophic and ultimately inaccurate overpopulation scenarios in the 1960s and 1970s contributed to several countries adopting forced sterilization and abortion programs, including China’s one-child policy, which caused up to 100 million coerced abortions, disproportionately of girls. Past and present fascist and neofascist movements frequently use fears of environmental catastrophe to promote eugenics and oppose immigration and aid.

The PNAS article then discusses one fact that is truly alarming: surveys show the overemphasis on apocalyptic climate projections has resulted in 45 percent of the world’s youth feeling climate change is negatively affecting their lives, and because of that, approximately 40 percent of the youths surveyed say they are considering not having children. That is truly tragic.

Whether people choose to have children is none of my business. However, an entire generation should not be misled into rejecting having children based on a false climate alarm suggesting that any kids they have will be a burden on the Earth or be condemned to a lifelong struggle in an environmental wasteland. Both of those claims are lies. All the available evidence suggests the future for humans and the environment will be better than the past.

I’ll conclude with a quote from Lueken I think sums up the issue quite well:

Climate alarmists exaggerate the rate of recent warming and the risks of extreme weather to motivate radical political actions. The editorial board of the Colorado Springs Gazette and the PNAS should be thanked for making this point. The Earth’s climate does change, and will continue to do so, and it is wise to meet this change with realistic mitigation efforts. An overcorrection imposed by world governments, like banning fossil fuels, is likely to cause far more harm and destruction than climate change itself.

TRUDEAU’S ‘CLIMATE EMERGENCY’ CLAIMS REFUTED BY DATA … ICEMAN DISCOVERY SUGGESTS ALPS GLACIERS NATURALLY WAX AND WANE … IN MEMORIAM: GEORGE TAYLOR

TRUDEAU’S ‘CLIMATE EMERGENCY’ CLAIMS REFUTED BY DATA

Engineer Ron Barmby, author of Sunlight on Climate Change: A Heretic’s Guide to Global Climate Hysteria, says Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should rescind his June 2019 declaration of a National Climate Emergency in support of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

Barmby notes mounting evidence refutes the claim climate change is causing an increase in the severity or number of extreme weather events and that temperatures are not rising as fast as projected.

Citing a recent paper by Italian physicist Gianluca Alimonti and others, “A critical assessment of extreme events trends in times of global warming,” in The European Physical Journal Plus, Barmby notes Alimonti found “…on the basis of observational data, the climate crisis that, according to many sources, we are experiencing today, is not evident yet” (emphasis by Barmby).

Barmby cites several conclusions of the journal article, including the following, in his words:

“ Hurricanes : The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has stated ‘… it is premature to conclude … human activities have had a detectable impact on Atlantic basin hurricane activity.’ …

: The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has stated ‘… it is premature to conclude … human activities have had a detectable impact on Atlantic basin hurricane activity.’ … “ Tornadoes: The authors conclude ‘… strong to violent tornadoes … show no increase over time.’ …

The authors conclude ‘… strong to violent tornadoes … show no increase over time.’ … “Floods and Droughts: This increase in global precipitation ‘… does not translate into an increase in intensity or frequency of floods.’ Additionally, ‘… there is no evidence that the areas affected by the different types of drought are increasing.'”

Because extreme weather events aren’t worsening, much less an existential threat to humanity, Trudeau’s only remaining argument for declaring a climate emergency is a rising average global temperature, which available data shows to be an even more tenuous argument, Barmby argues.

The United States Climate Reference Network, established in 2005 to provide continental U.S. temperature data “using state-of-the-art triple redundant instruments in pristine locations unaffected by human activities,” has recorded no warming trend since the system was established 18 years ago, Barmby reminds those interested in facts. In addition, satellite data shows temperatures are no higher now than they were at their modern peak in 1998, and since 1979 they display only a 0.11℃ warming per decade, which is less than what the climate models have predicted and certainly not an emergency.

“In aggregate, this would suggest that in an open and fair scientific inquiry, Mr. Trudeau would be hard-pressed to defend a claim of a current climate emergency,” concludes Barmby. “It’s time to have a rational, dispassionate, and independent review of Canada’s climate emergency declaration. Canadians have a right to know the science.”

ICEMAN DISCOVERY SUGGESTS ALPS GLACIERS NATURALLY WAX AND WANE

Peer-reviewed research published in the journal Holocene indicates glaciers in the Alps have expanded and retreated multiple times over the past 6,000 years, contrary to common claims. This indicates the present glacial decline is not historically unusual, and it casts doubt on the claim the current retreat is being driven by purported human-caused climate change.

Many experts have asserted that Ötzi, the ice-age corpse found at Tisenjoch in the Alps in 1991, was uncovered for the first time in 5,300 years only because the ice melted primarily due to human-caused global warming. This claim has now been refuted by a team of researchers from universities in Norway, Switzerland, and Austria.

When Ötzi was discovered, the initial lead investigator “hypothesised that the mummy with associated artefacts had been quickly covered by glacier ice and stayed buried until the melt-out in 1991,” the researchers write.

The research team examined evidence from other glacial archaeological sites; used an improved understanding of glacial ice balance, advance, and retreat developed since Ötzi was initially discovered; and more closely examined the biological remains and the materials found with and around Ötzi. They write,

[B]enefitting from increased knowledge gained from more than two decades of investigations …, it is likely that Ötzi was not permanently buried in ice immediately after his death, but that the gully where he lay was repeatedly exposed over the next 1500 years. Based on the available evidence, this ice is better understood as a non-moving, stationary field of snow and ice, frozen to the bedrock. The damaged artefacts found with Ötzi were probably broken by typical postdepositional processes on glacial archaeological sites, and not, as previously claimed, during conflict prior to Ötzi’s flight from the valley below.

The research indicates Ötzi died on the snow at a higher elevation, with the corpse only later sliding into the hollow where it was ultimately found. During alternating warming and cooling periods, the body and Ötzi’s equipment were repeatedly exposed and reburied by snow and ice, during which the body and tools were damaged.

The researchers detailed the evidence they found indicating Ötzi had been repeatedly exposed to and protected from the weather, writing in the journal article and for the Swiss online journal NZZ.

“The state of preservation also speaks against Ötzi being a time capsule from the ice,” the scientists write. “Twenty years ago, examinations of hairline cracks in the skull already showed that the corpse had repeatedly thawed and refrozen,” NZZ writes. “The part of the fur coat lying under the body was much better preserved than the rest, and on the back of Ötzi’s head—he was lying face down—the skin had disappeared. This also indicates that the body was exposed several times.”

In addition, had Ötzi remained undisturbed under the ice for 5,300 years, newer material from more recent ages would not have been found on, around, or underneath the corpse. Yet a large amount of material from more recent periods of time—such as plants, animal droppings, feathers, and a piece of wood, all from different time periods—were found with Ötzi. This strongly suggests the ice Ötzi was trapped in melted, refroze, and accumulated again repeatedly after Ötzi’s deposition in the hollow.

IN MEMORIAM: GEORGE TAYLOR

It is with deep regret that I write that meteorologist George Taylor has passed away after a long battle with a degenerative illness.

After obtaining degrees in mathematics and meteorology, Taylor was director of the Oregon Climate Service at Oregon State University (OSU) from 1989 until he retired in 2008. Taylor became Oregon’s state climatologist in 1991, and he served as president of the American Association of State Climatologists from 1998 to 2000. Taylor published more than 200 reports, symposium articles, and journal articles.

Taylor was steadfast in his view that climate science must be grounded in data and the data did not support the claim human greenhouse gas emissions were creating a climate catastrophe. Because Taylor’s views on climate change were at odds with those of then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski, a nonscientist with no research experience on climate change, Kulongoski removed Taylor from the position of state climatologist in 2007.

After his retirement from OSU, Taylor founded Applied Climate Services (ACS), a consulting firm. He remained president of ACS until illness forced his retirement.

Over the course of his career, Taylor gave dozens of talks and presentations at meetings and conferences where climate science was discussed. Among these were the 2012 meeting of the Oregon Chapter of the American Meteorological Society and the first two International Conferences on Climate Change hosted by The Heartland Institute, where he discussed “Long-Term Variability in Temperature and Precipitation” in 2008 and “The Pacific Decadal Oscillation: A Dominant Mode of Climate Variability” in 2009.

Taylor’s illness prevented him from contributing to the climate debate in recent years, but before becoming ill he was active in refuting alarming claims about pending climate doom.

Wikipedia describes some of his views on climate change, based on his education, research, and experience:

[H]e has argued that “consensus in science doesn’t really mean much. What matters is the truth. Often consensus is wrong.” Taylor considers global warming to be primarily caused by natural variability, not human activity, though he acknowledges that both have played a role. In 2005, Taylor testified before the Environment Committee of the Oregon House of Representatives in opposition to a bill that would increase the fuel efficiency standards for automobiles in Oregon to match California’s. In his testimony, he said, “I believe the effect of greenhouse gas is a relatively minor one,” and “I really believe natural variation and natural factors are a bigger cause of climate change than you and I.”

Even in the face of personal and professional persecution, Taylor never wavered in his commitment to using the scientific method informed by data to understand climate change. He will be missed by many.

Escaping from the COP-27 Insane Asylum,Paul Driessen,"“Show us the money!” climate activists demand, and rich countries are expected to pony up.

Do I hear $100 billion? Would you give $1 trillion? Now, then, would you give $2 trillion?

The climate reparations bidding war is on. What began at $100-billion-a-year at COP-21 in Paris rapidly ballooned to $1.3-trillion on the eve of COP-27 in Sharm-el-Sheikh-Down, Egypt and now stands at $2.4-trillion annually! And we’re nowhere near “going once, going twice, sold.”

Of course, it was always about the money – endless sums of cash supposedly to help developing countries (like China!) adapt to dangerous manmade climate change, cover entire regions with wind and solar, and secure “fair, just and equitable” reparations for soaring temperatures, rising seas, destructive storms, floods, droughts and famines allegedly caused by countries that have used fossil fuels since 1850.

Yes, China. The Middle Kingdom has long postured itself as a developing country, when it comes to when it might start building fewer coal-fired power plants and slowly shift to “renewable” energy.

Now China says it will pay non-cash climate reparations, if the United States pays in dollars. Of course, any US, UK, German, et cetera “fair share” would be exorbitant – and paid while they “transition” rapidly away from fossil fuels, regardless of the economic, social and ecological costs.

As Oliver Hardy would say, “Another fine mess you’ve gotten me into,” Joe, John and the rest of Team Biden’s climate-obsessed, fossil-fuel-eradicating, eco-justice warriors.

They and their activist, media and academia allies created the climate scare – the assertion that fossil fuel emissions alone are driving today’s climate and weather. Never mind that, since the last Pleistocene ice age, average global temperatures climbed significantly (Baruch Hashem); sea levels rose some 400 feet; and floods, droughts, hurricanes and other disasters ravaged planet and humanity countless times. Anything happening today, however, is due to countries that got rich using fossil fuels. Or so they insist.

Therefore, naturally, COP-27 organizers, activists and attendees now say the “climate crisis” requires enormous payments from rich countries to poor countries – or more accurately, from poor people in rich countries to rich kleptocrats in poor countries. That raises another inconvenient truth.

Not long ago, Obama “science advisor” John Holdren intoned: “Only one rational path is open to us – simultaneous de-development of the [United States and other over-developed countries] and semi-development of the under-developed countries, in order to approach a decent and ecologically sustainable standard of living for all in between.” This de-development ideology is shared by many others.

Well, de-development and de-industrialization are already underway in Britain, Germany and elsewhere, because wind, solar and battery (WSB) energy cannot possibly replace abundant, reliable, affordable, non-weather-dependent fossil fuel and nuclear energy. Jobs, companies and entire industries are already disappearing across Europe, as it destroys fossil fuel power plants but has nothing viable to replace them.

So how are all these de-developing Formerly Rich Countries (FRCs) going to deliver billions or trillions annually, to pay climate reparations and help poor countries develop? They cannot possibly do so.

Even worse, eco-imperialist developed countries continue demanding that poor countries develop only to the minimal extent that WSB technologies would permit. Rich countries, the World Bank and global financial institutions refuse to finance anything but pseudo-renewable energy.

These unconscionable policies perpetuate joblessness, poverty, disease and death – and advance the other basic goal of “climate stabilization” programs: controlling our lives and living standards. But poor nations have inalienable, God-given rights to develop, using fossil fuel, nuclear and hydroelectric power – and petroleum as feed stocks for fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, plastics and hundreds of other miraculous life-enhancing, life-saving products (developed by countries that are now expected to pay reparations).

Developed nations must help developing nations reach those goals. Instead, they too often block pathways to better lives. Still more outrageous, the USA and Europe have the nerve to ask African, Asian and Latin American nations to produce more oil and gas, but only for export to the USA and Europe!

Meanwhile, Britain is setting up “warm rooms,” where people can go for a few hours a day, instead of freezing hungry and jobless in dark apartments. It’s as though Merry Old England has suddenly been transported back to the Middle Ages, by politicians who put climate virtue signaling above their constituents’ basic needs.

Meanwhile, Germany is dismantling an industrial wind power installation – so that it can extract the lignite coal underneath, to run generating plants, to keep factories operating and homes warm!

Even crazier, these are just a few examples of the insanity gripping the world’s political classes, especially during Conferences of Parties (COPs) on climate change. Happily, escaping this insane asylum requires little more than recognizing a few simple realities.

* The vast majority of nations signed the Paris climate treaty for the money – most of which they are now beginning to realize they will never receive. Moreover, coal, oil and natural gas still provide 82% of the world’s energy; nuclear, hydroelectric and biomass (wood and dung) provide most remaining energy needs, and less than 2% comes from wind and solar.

* Developing countries will be using fossil fuels for decades to come – and emitting more plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide in the process – much of it to extract the raw materials and manufacture the “green tech” they will export to the US, UK, EU and other soon-to-be-FRCs. So even if developed countries totally eliminated their fossil fuel use, atmospheric greenhouse gas levels will continue to climb.

* But that won’t matter, because there is no evidence that we face a climate crisis, much less a manmade climate crisis, much less changes unprecedented in Earth or human history. Humans are likely affecting temperature, humidity, climate and weather to some degree, especially around large urban “heat islands.” But that is a far cry from cataclysms allegedly resulting from fossil fuels replacing the powerful natural forces that have controlled climate and weather throughout history.

* The 1.5 degrees C that we are supposed to avoid to avert catastrophe is arbitrary, meaningless – and tied not just to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, but to the end of the Little Ice Age. Another degree or two of warming would be mostly beneficial, whereas another little or big ice age would devastate agriculture, habitats, wildlife and humanity.

* The entire climate crisis agenda is based on computer models that (a) cannot possibly reflect all the forces that govern climate, and (b) consistently predict planetary warming that is two to three times greater than actually recorded by satellites, weather balloons and surface temperature monitors.

* Basing economy-destroying, life-altering policies on useless models is sheer insanity – especially if the replacement energy comes from WSB systems that would require mining, processing, manufacturing and installations on scales that would ravage our planet.

The only reason these realities are so little known is that climate activists, politicians, academics, and news and social media studiously demonize, harass, censor, silence, deplatform and demonetize scientists, economists and energy experts who challenge climate crisis narratives.

Thankfully, the Truth is slowly winning out. Perhaps COP-27 will bring a healthy dose of climate and energy sanity. If it doesn’t, we could end up with John Holdren’s formula for rolling back development and living standards. Just don’t expect the ruling elites and their Hollywood and Big Tech allies to lead by example.","November 16, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/escaping-from-the-cop-27-insane-asylum/
COP27 — Will “Loss and Damage” Extremism Kill National Alarmism?,David Wojick,"The extreme rhetoric of “loss and damage reparations” could backfire, causing developed countries to question the developing country claims of human caused damage. The best defense against a ruinous liability claim is innocence.

Until now the alarmist governments of America and the other developed countries have gleefully touted the emergency threat of human caused climate change, because it gave them immense power. They happily boasted of transforming our society and transitioning our energy system, all to save us from the ever increasing greenhouse gasses.

Central to this alarmist narrative is the theme that the world is already suffering heavily from human caused climate change. Every weather disaster is now called a “climate event” or some silly such.

Well as we say in the mountains: “What goes around, comes around”.

The climate damage narrative has now come to bite the developed countries, and bite them really hard. In principle ruinously hard.

The logic of loss and damage is impeccable. If you accept the human caused destruction narrative then the developed countries are clearly responsible for most of the damage. In addition to damaging themselves they are damaging the developing countries who have had little to do with the 150 year run up in greenhouse gasses.

At COP27 the developed countries agreed to put loss and damage on the agenda, so long as liability was not addressed. That deal collapsed on day one when national leaders addressed the COP. Many developing countries hammered on supposed “reparations” owed by the developed countries. One even said it was “criminal”.

REPARATIONS has now become the theme of the COP. Most news stories feature that nasty word. How this will play out in the actual, possibly ruined, negotiations is anybody’s guess.

The technical issues of possible responsibility under the doctrine of human caused “climate chaos”(as the alarmists now call it) are formidable. They are both hairy and fuzzy. There is no claim to attribute a given extreme event to specific emissions. Attribution is done by comparing a model run which includes the (supposed) totality of human forcing to one without that forcing. The difference is due to us, but only in a very general way.

Note that the extreme event does not actually appear in this modeling because they are too small and brief. So the so-called attribution scientists look for broader differences that might be linked to the event. They also ignore that different models give very different regional change results, plus they differ on human forcing.

And in any event the finding is just a change in probability of the event in question. How that change translates to responsibility is unclear. If we made a storm 20% more likely does that mean we owe 20% of the damages, or what? I doubt there is a rational answer to this silly question.

Thus the science of attribution is shaky (and hairy), which might be a defense against liability, but that supposed science does exist. An lengthy introduction to the science, written by alarmists that believe in it, is here:

https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/21852/attribution-of-extreme-weather-events-in-the-context-of-climate-change

National responsibility would then be a matter of how much that country contributed to the total forcing. Another hairy and fuzzy question.

Since I do not believe the doctrine of destructive human caused climate chaos, this whole reparations drill has the aspect of Theatre of the Absurd. The governments of the world debating about something that does not exist and who should pay for it!

On the other hand, this wacky reparations nonsense could lead to serious questioning of AGW. Let’s hope so. After all the best defense to a claim of liability is innocence. We are not causing climate damage. No harm, no foul. The skeptics have volumes of evidence to this effect, which governments might finally find useful.

But the hairy, fuzzy issues of attribution and liability are well off in the future. For now the COP issue is whether or not to create a formal facility to handle the hoped for (and demanded) financial flows.

Given all the nasty words heaped on America et al, it will be very interesting to see how the professional diplomats handle this mess, if they can. There is a lot of COP27 to go.

"No Consensus on Climate Crisis, Scientist Survey Finds",H. Sterling Burnett,"The Heartland Institute recently commissioned a survey by Fairleigh Dickinson University to get scientists’ thoughts on climate change. The survey results dispel the notion that 97 percent of relevant scientists believe humans are causing catastrophic climate change. Instead, Heartland’s poll found the percentage of earth scientists who believe anthropogenic climate change will “significantly harm” people’s standard of living in our lifetimes is far lower than previously reported: 59 percent.

Fairleigh Dickinson surveyed 400 people who hold at least a bachelor’s degree in the academic fields most pertinent to the climate debate, including meteorology, climatology, physics, geology, and hydrology. Ninety-five percent of the respondents fell into the categories of meteorology (72 percent) or climatology (23 percent), so physicists and geologists, among others, were underrepresented, in my opinion. Only 24 percent of those surveyed had advanced degrees in their respective fields, and only 6 percent had Ph.Ds.

It is unfortunate that the sample size wasn’t larger and the poll didn’t survey more people with advanced degrees who are conducting and publishing research on climate change. I also wish more physicists and geologists had been surveyed. Oh, well; as with every other poll, you can only survey those who agree to be interviewed.

Unsurprisingly, the poll found 96 percent of those surveyed believe climate change is occurring, and on average they attribute 75 percent of the change to human activity. Beyond those two points, there is nothing approaching a consensus among the scientists.

As my Heartland colleague Chris Talgo wrote in an article for Townhall discussing the survey, “even among the 59 percent of scientists who expect significant harm at some point in our lifetimes, the term ‘significant harm’ is a far cry from the term ‘crisis’ that is often employed by climate activists and the media.”

Forty percent of those surveyed were either unsure whether any harm would occur, thought climate change might cause slight harm, or believed climate change would result in a slight or significant improvement in the lives of people living today. The remaining respondents said they do not believe climate change is occurring.

More than four-fifths of those surveyed said extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires have increased significantly (41 percent) or slightly (46 percent) in recent years. This shows, however, not that extreme weather has in fact worsened, but that the perception of many scientists has been skewed by media coverage, anecdotal claims, and the influence of their colleagues—sources vastly different from hard data, peer-reviewed research, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports. I say this because the available data show just the opposite.

Concerning this point, another Heartland colleague, Linnea Lueken, wrote the following for Heartland Daily News:

What this poll confirms is that in thinking about extreme weather events, scientists often don’t follow the scientific method or the established rules for scientific forecasting as laid out by Kesten Green and J. Scott Armstrong in their series of papers, studies, and presentations on the subject. Green and Armstrong write,

… dire predictions are not, however, the result of scientific forecasting; rather, they are the opinions of experts. Expert opinion on climate change has often been wrong. … Climate scientists now use computer models, but there is no evidence that modeling improves the accuracy of predictions. For example, according to the models, the Earth should be warmer than actual measurements show it to be.

Commenting on this point in a press release, Heartland Institute President James Taylor said, “the Scientific Method requires that we engage in science by testing and analyzing theories according to objective data rather than asking for a show of hands.”

Another interesting finding of the study is the generational and experiential divide it reveals.

Heartland Senior Fellow Anthony Watts and I find it instructive that only a minority of the older, more-experienced scientists surveyed, ages 50 and above, said climate change presents a serious danger. Of those surveyed, it seems more-seasoned professionals have more-moderate opinions on the effects of climate change: their responses were more consistent with existing data, in contrast to the more-extreme, alarmist views of younger respondents.

“Just 44 percent of scientists over 50 years old believed climate change would reduce our standard of living in our lifetimes,” Watts said. “Further, just 38 percent were convinced severe weather events have increased.”

My conclusion about this observation is that the more experience one has as a researcher, the more skeptical one becomes of extreme claims. The evidence suggests years of indoctrination have succeeded in programming younger, less-experienced climate scientists into believing humans are causing a climate catastrophe even though the data say otherwise.

So, do the survey participants believe the climate is changing? Yes. (And they should, as it is always changing.) Are humans responsible for most of it? Those polled say yes. Is this causing a catastrophe? No agreement.

CLIMATE CRISIS AIN’T WHAT IT USED TO BE … U.S. OFFSHORE WIND HITS ECONOMIC WALL

CLIMATE CRISIS AIN’T WHAT IT USED TO BE

Writing at Climate Etc., climate scientist Judith Curry notes at least some of her colleagues are being forced by facts to reduce their estimates of expected warming from a doubling of carbon dioxide. That should also reduce their estimates of potential damage to result from warming, Curry notes. Curry writes,

Growing realization by the climate establishment that the threat of future warming has been cut in half over the past 5 years. Summary: The climate “catastrophe” isn’t what it used to be. Circa 2013 with publication of the IPCC AR5 Report, RCP8.5 was regarded as the business-as-usual emissions scenario, with expected warming of 4 to 5 ℃ by 2100. Now there is growing acceptance that RCP8.5 is implausible, and RCP4.5 is arguably the current business-as-usual emissions scenario. Only a few years ago, an emissions trajectory that followed RCP4.5 with 2 to 3 ℃ warming was regarded as climate policy success. … The mainstream media is currently awash with articles from prominent journalists on how the global warming threat [is] less than we thought. Here are some prominent articles: § NYTimes David Wallace-Wells: Beyond catastrophe: A new climate reality is coming into view. § WSJ: Good climate change news is fit to print. Slowly its percolating into the journalistic mind that recent research is upbeat § NYT Bret Stephens: Yes Greenland’s melting but . . . David Wallace-Wells is one of the most interesting journalists writing in the climate space. In 2017, he wrote a New York Magazine article titled “The Uninhabitable Earth”, with subtitle: “Famine, economic collapse, a sun that cooks us: What climate change could wreak—sooner than you think.” Not long after publication of his book in 2019 entitled The Uninhabitable Earth, David Wallace-Wells made this statement: “Anyone, including me, who has built their understanding on what level of warming is likely this century on that RCP8.5 scenario should probably revise that understanding in a less alarmist direction.”

Unfortunately, even as alarmists are being forced in part by a better understanding of climate sensitivity to abandon the most-extreme temperature scenario, they irresponsibly claim the harm from warming will be worse than alarmists had previously claimed, Curry notes. Curry responds:

[T]he IPCC AR6 provides very meager fodder to support [claims that scientists have underestimated the impact of warming]. Apart from sea level rise, which is unambiguously associated with global warming, there is no prima facie reason that extreme weather events would worsen in a warming climate. Observational evidence, provided that you go back at least to 1900, shows that nearly all horrible, recent weather and climate disasters have precedents in the 20th century and hence “detection” is very challenging. Climate models are not fit-for-purpose to simulate extreme weather events, let alone to attribute them to human caused warming.

U.S. OFFSHORE WIND HITS ECONOMIC WALL

“Plans for massive offshore wind farms that President Joe Biden hopes will power as many as 10 million American homes by 2030 are starting to wobble,” reports Bloomberg. On October 31, the New Jersey utility Public Service Enterprise Group (PSEG), which owns 25 percent of the project, said it was considering pulling out of Ocean Wind 1, Bloomberg reports.

If constructed, Ocean Wind 1 will be the largest offshore wind facility off the coast of New Jersey. Its 98 12-megawatt turbines will be located 13 miles offshore from Atlantic City. As planned it would generate 1.1 gigawatts, enough for 500,000 homes.

On a call with investors, PSEG Chief Executive Ralph LaRossa said high costs and construction delays were forcing the company to reconsider its participation in the project. Majority shareholder Orsted Offshore North America admitted in July that inflation and supply chain problems were forcing changes to the company’s near-term offshore wind plans.

There is even-worse news for offshore wind boosters. In mid-October “New England utility Avangrid Inc. said its similarly sized Commonwealth Wind project was no longer viable because of higher costs and supply chain woes,” writes Bloomberg.

The Spanish energy company Iberdrola SA, which owns Avangrid, told Massachusetts regulators its 1.2-gigawatt Commonwealth Wind project is economically infeasible under current power-purchase agreements.

“‘Global commodity price increases, in part due to ongoing war in Ukraine, sharp and sudden increases in interest rates, prolonged supply chain constraints, and persistent inflation have significantly increased the expected cost of constructing the project,’ [Avangrid’s] attorneys said in the filing,” reports Bloomberg.

Avangrid has asked state regulators to pause their review of the contract for one month, to allow the company to reevaluate the timeline and cost estimates for the project, to which its lawyers said the company is still committed.

“A one-month suspension would give the parties an opportunity to evaluate the current situation facing the project and potentially agree upon changes to the PPAs … that could allow the project to return to viability,” they wrote. Translation: consumers will have to pay even more.

The problem with offshore wind is that it costs a lot in both capital and labor. High inflation and rising interest rates are hampering financing, and supply-chain problems are creating materials shortages and extending the timelines for construction and completion.

For the public, the problem with offshore wind is its intermittency and expense: it often cannot supply the promised power, and it is the highest-cost source of electricity. That means New Jersey and Massachusetts residents, whose power costs are already among the highest in the nation, will get hit with even-higher prices and greater likelihood of blackouts.

Oh, and by the way, there is no evidence whatsoever Ocean Wind 1, Commonwealth, or the numerous other politically motivated wind boondoggles will decrease climate change in the slightest. The best thing for consumers would be if all the Biden administration’s grand schemes for offshore wind power fail.

Re-elected Governor Newsom’s Energy Literacy Will Be Challenged Over the Next 4 Years,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","Despite Newsom’s statewide policy decisions that are driving up costs of energy in the state, only a few Californians are upset with the ever-increasing costs for their electricity and gasoline, resulting in the excessive costs of living, increasing homelessness and crime. But most voters have just showed their approval of the bizarre energy policies that Newsom promotes and wish to incur four more years of financial torture.

The continuous exodus of residents from the state has resulted in a loss of a representative in Washington for the first time in its 171-year history. Departing residents are being followed by large corporations and privately owned businesses that have moved their headquarters out of California in 2021 at twice their rate in both 2020 and 2019 and at three times their rate in 2018.

California has a history of having the highest gasoline prices in the country. Why? For one, the West Coast fuels market is isolated from other supply/demand centers as California is an energy island. The Sierra Mountains are a natural barrier that prevents the state from pipeline access to any of that excess oil. As such, the West Coast is susceptible to unexpected outages of West Coast refineries as it is unable to backfill an unexpected loss in supply by quickly supplying additional products from outside of the region.

Newsom is emphatically complaining that the oil companies are making outlandish profits, but he may be out of touch with reality as two California refineries have shut down under his current watch and two more may be closing in his new term.

Under Newsom’s watch in the last few years, two of California’s refineries have virtually shut down and are no longer manufacturing gasoline, aviation fuels, or any oil derivatives. Those two, Phillips66 at Rodeo and Marathon at Martinez, are now only focusing on renewable diesel.

More financial sad news may occur under Newsom’s next term with the permanent closure of two more California refineries, the Chevron Refinery at Richmond and the PBF Refinery at Martinez. If the courts uphold the 2021 Bay Area Air Quality Management (BAAQMD) rule 6-5 for a further reduction in particulate emissions, both have stated that they will shut down before spending one billion dollars to retrofit their refineries to comply with further particulate emission reductions.

The world has seen the impact on Germany and Britain with their dependency on Russia for most of its energy, but for the 4th largest economy in the world, in California, Newsom already has the State more than 56 percent dependent on imported crude oil, but continuously seeks further reductions of in-state oil production that places greater dependency on foreign countries.

California’s growing dependency on foreign countries is a national security risk for all of America. Does Newsom expect a better outcome than what Germany and Britain experienced by not controlling more of its energy future demands?

I’m sure that Newsom had a chance to view the 2006 movie “Blood Diamonds” starring Leonardo DiCaprio that portrays many of the similar atrocities now occurring in pursuit of the “Blood Minerals” i.e., those exotic minerals and metals to support the “green” movement within wealthy countries that continue promoting environmental degradation to landscapes in developing countries, and imposes humanity atrocities to citizens with yellow, brown, and black skinned workers being exploited for the green movement of the few wealthy nations.

Despite the Biden administration’s declaration that EV battery materials from China may be tainted by child labor made with materials known to be produced with child or forced labor, Newsom continues to support subsidies to procure EV’s and build more wind and solar when those subsidies are providing financial incentives to the developing countries mining for those “green” materials that promotes further exploitations of poor people in developing countries. I personally thought that Newsom had higher moral and ethical standards that would stop him from exploiting the poor in developing countries.

Newsom seems to be oblivious to the reality that everything that needs electricity is made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, but Newsom continues to support wind and solar that only generate intermittent electricity but cannot manufacture anything for society. Newsom has yet to identify a replacement for the oil derivatives that are the basis of more than 6,000 products and fuels for our various transportation infrastructures, and the economy.

Life Without Oil is NOT AS SIMPLE AS NEWSOM MAY THINK as renewable energy is only intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine as NEITHER wind turbines nor solar panels can manufacture anything for society. Climate change may impact humanity but being mandated to live without the products manufactured from oil will necessitate lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s and could be the greatest threat to civilization’s eight billion residents.

In Newsom’s all-electric world, Newsom’s bizarre energy policies reflect his believes that all the infrastructures developed in less than two centuries, from the products manufactured from crude oil, are NOT needed by future societies, such as medical, electronics, communications, and the many transportation infrastructures such as airlines, merchant ships, automobiles, trucks, military, and the space programs.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), California’s high cost of electricity is already fifty percent higher than the national average for residents, and double the national averages for commercial, and are projected to go even higher.

California is the nation’s top producer of electricity from solar, geothermal, and biomass, but the inability to replace the closure of continuously uninterruptable electricity from nuclear and natural gas power plants with intermittent electricity from renewables is causing the state to import more of its electricity.

Again, under Newsom’s watch, the EIA says that California imports more electricity than any other US state, more than twice the amount of Virginia, the second largest importer of electricity.

Newsom’s policies continue to force California to be the only state in contiguous America that imports most of its crude oil energy from foreign countries. That dependence has increased imported crude oil from foreign countries from 5 percent in 1992 to 56 percent today of total consumption.

At today’s price of crude oil approaching $100 per barrel the imported crude oil costs California more than $150 million dollars a day, yes, every day, being paid to oil-rich foreign countries, depriving Californians of jobs and business opportunities, and drivers to pay these premium prices for fuel.

Richer countries now have higher gasoline prices, while poorer countries and countries that produce and export oil have lower cost for fuels. A review of global petroleum gasoline prices per gallon in U.S. dollars shows the international intelligence and trends of gasoline prices of the wealthy countries that have opted to go “green” at any cost, compared with poorer countries and countries that produce and export oil.

Another issue that Newsom will not discuss is funding for future road maintenance. Newsom has mandated no sales of internal combustion engine vehicles after 2035 but appears incapable of acknowledging that heavier EV’s contribute nothing for road maintenance and repairs. California has almost 400,000 miles of roadways that are heavily dependent on road taxes from fuels that contribute more than $8.8 billion annually, the same tax base that also funds the environmental programs that will be diminishing in the decades ahead.

Maybe Newsom will produce a plan in the next four years to finance the billions of dollars for the roads being used by EV’s or just pass that problem on to his predecessor.

California voters had a chance to recall Newsom in 2021 but chose to support his bizarre and expensive energy policies. Following the failed recall, Newsom was just re-elected by the voters that are willing to accept the highest energy costs in America. Voters support his avoidance of addressing those tough energy policy questions that would expose his limited energy literacy over the next four years of financial torture upon the working class that voted for him.

"UN COP27: It’s a Gas, Gas, Gas",David Wojick,"Who would have guessed that a UN COP would turn into a promotion point for fossil fuel development? COP27 is looking that way, thanks to the energy crisis and Africa’s determination to develop itself.

After all, these are developing countries, right? In this case some of them want to develop, use and sell their abundant natural gas resources. Imagine the green horror! Poor countries actually making money from fossil fuels.

How, or even if, this rapidly emerging issue will get on the COP 27 table remains to be seen, but it is certainly a lively topic of discussion on the side. Europe needs gas and Africa has it; green agenda be damned.

Here are just a few of the high points on this fascinating new issue.

In June the EU Parliament made gas green. I am not making this up. Their action made this fossil fuel eligible for a bunch of subsides and related green goodies. It also opened the door to investment.

About the same time a bunch of African nations issued the Kigali Communique, saying this:

We “Support Africa in the deployment of gas as a transition fuel….”

The signers are Ministers and high-level representatives from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.

More recently Germany and Poland’s top dogs actually went to Senegal to talk up development of its considerable natural gas resources. Other EU leaders and ministers have visited other African countries. America is doing a bunch of gas investment too.

Numerous deals are in the works, including tapping many new gas fields, building pipelines and building or enlarging LNG terminals and ports. For example, Mozambique is seeking to double its LNG poetry capacity.

Getting off Russian gas means getting on African gas. It is that simple.

Of course everyone gives lip service to a far distant net zero goal, calling gas a “transition” step. In the meantime GET THE GAS. This so-called transition might last right thru 2030 or even 2050.

The green agenda can be turned around without a word to that effect. In politics and diplomacy you never have to admit error. You just stop doing the wrong thing.

Africa already sees a lot of gas production so this is just more of the same, a lot more. Here is a quick list of the major existing gas produces, with their rank in global production. Of course none is close to the giants — America and Russia — but they clearly know how to get the gas.

Algeria 5th globally

Nigeria 12th

Egypt 20th

Libya 40th

Note that COP27 host Egypt is high on the list of gas producers. They may well want to get gas onto the table. Egypt’s foreign minister and Cop27 president Sameh Shoukry Is quoted saying “We might see in gas a transitional source of energy with certainly less emissions”. Better than coal, right? Not that gas is replacing coal as we are talking about growth and development.

The president of COP26 tabled a whole set of radical proposals so we shall see what happens in COP27 as far as gas goes. A logical place for it to emerge is on the topic of new commitments, which is supposed to be central to the discussion.

But as I said, the gas work may just happen along side the COP27 climate negotiations. Many countries send dozens of delegates, while some send over a hundred. Few of these folks actually sit in on the negotiations and there is no room for them to do so. Cutting deals is likely.

What is never reported is the huge international carnival that each COP also includes. Some countries actually have big pavilions, where they give away free stuff by the bag full. There are also hundreds of presentations over the ever do long deliberations. These are called side events and here is a recent list:

https://seors.unfccc.int/applications/seors/reports/events_list.html?session_id=COP%2027

I have not measured this list but it looks to be over seven feet of small print.

In short the energy crisis is rolling the climate agenda, using natural gas for power. Whether or not gas becomes a COP27 discussion point remains to be seen.

How the COP handles the energy crisis is a fascinating question. Maybe the gas gorilla will just sit there quietly while the talks drone on. Maybe not.

Green Energy Revolution Hits Energy Reality Wall,H. Sterling Burnett,"If carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are causing dangerous climate change, China is the straw that stirs the drink. China emits more carbon dioxide than all the developed countries on Earth combined.

There is the rub. In his speech kicking off the annual weeklong Communist Party Congress, President Xi Jinping announced fossil fuels have a strong future in China as energy security will be among the country’s top priorities in attempting to advance economic growth. At the end of the conference, in a historic but not unexpected event, Xi was elected to an unprecedented third five-year term as general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

Xi said aspirational goals to peak and eventually zero out carbon emissions would be tempered with prudence given the recent power shortages following from a limited amount of renewable power sources replacing fossil fuels for electric power generation over the past few years.

Despite China’s commitment to peak carbon emissions between 2030 and 2035, in 2021 the communist state significantly expanded coal mining and use in response to power shortages that idled factories and slowed economic growth.

Xi’s speech restated China’s position that it will not end the use of fossil fuels until enough sufficient, reliable non-emitting energy sources are available to replace them.

“We will work actively and prudently toward the goals of reaching peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality,” Xi said in his address. “Based on China’s energy and resource endowments, we will advance initiatives to reach peak carbon emissions in a well-planned and phased way, in line with the principle of getting the new before discarding the old.”

In addition to increasing coal use, Xi’s spokespersons also made it clear China will expand its exploration and development of oil and gas resources to ensure energy security.

China is not the only country placing shoring up energy security ahead of fighting climate change. The New York Times and National Public Radio both reported on Germany’s race to reopen and expand coal mines and restart previously shuttered coal-fueled power plants in the face of a severe power shortfall entering the fall and winter. Germany previously shut coal power and nuclear power plants and replaced them with huge investments in wind and solar, with Russian natural gas as the backstop. Germans currently pay the highest prices for electricity in all of Europe. As wind and solar have failed to supply reliable power and Russian gas has been cut off during the Ukraine war, Germans face a chilly winter if sufficient coal power plants can’t be brought online quickly.

Italy’s new leader has announced her party and its governing partners want to pull back on the carbon commitments Italy made to reach the EU’s climate goals. The AP reports Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s new prime minister, “contended that the European Union had failed to craft policies that would ensure available, affordable energy supplies. Sky-high energy prices ‘have forced businesses and families down to their knees,’ Meloni said.”

Meloni’s Brothers of Italy Party, unlike other parties that contended to control parliament and install the prime minister, has proposed no specific emission reduction targets, and Meloni has indicated her government will relax Italy’s emission reduction targets. Meloni has also indicated she and her parliamentary partners support reopening previously closed nuclear plants and developing domestic gas resources in the Adriatic Sea instead of just importing gas from foreign countries.

Real Clear Energy reports Vietnam has decided not to end coal to meet climate goals it set when it signed the Paris climate agreements. Vietnam now intends to increase coal use and imports for at least the next 13 years because more coal, natural gas, and oil are necessary to meet the country’s growing energy demands.

In Latin America, support for fossil fuels is breaking out all over. The Offshore Engineer reports Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Guyana, and Mexico are leading the way in new offshore oil and gas development, securing financing and granting leases for new production projects. State-owned and private companies are also purchasing tankers and equipment and developing refineries to advance energy independence while increasing exports of fuels for which they foresee growing global demand.

While leaders of countries across Asia, Europe, and South America still talk about the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to fight climate change, they are moving forward with policies guaranteed to increase emissions—not for emissions’ sake, of course, but to secure the reliable energy supplies necessary to ensure economic growth and their respective governments’ ability to remain in power.

Actions speak louder than words.

ESG PROMOTERS OVERSELL ITS VIRTUE, PROFITABILITY … SOUTH CAROLINA, MISSOURI JOIN ESG COUNTERREVOLUTION

ESG PROMOTERS OVERSELL ITS VIRTUE, PROFITABILITY

An article published by Bloomberg confirms environment, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives often support activities and programs that harm the environment and violate human rights, as previous research has shown. In addition, companies and stock funds committed to ESG goals are often unprofitable or at least produce lower returns than competitors and funds not committed to putting amorphous, often ill-defined, environment and social goals above profits.

ESG and DEI (“diversity, equity and inclusion”) “taken together … constitute the ruling business ideology of our age,” writes Bloomberg Global Business Columnist Adrian Wooldridge. “Both ESG and DEI have generated massive industries. Investment giants, notably BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp., and Vanguard Group Inc., claim that more than a third of their assets, or $35 trillion, are monitored through one ESG lens or other. Every Fortune 100 company and most Fortune 500 companies have adopted DEI programs.”

Despite all the hype, experience shows the various goals pursued under the banner of ESG and DEI conflict with each other. In pursuing environmental goals, for example, equity or human rights goals are undermined, writes Wooldridge. In addition, research shows the pursuit of these often-amorphous goals can lower investment returns, Wooldridge writes:

The apostles of ESG are as guilty of overselling their product as they are of intellectual sloppiness. The ghastly phrase “win-win” that is endemic in the industry obscures the huge costs of adjusting to climate change. But is it “win-win” for investors when, according to an analysis by Morningstar, “sustainable” funds charge on average annual fees that are almost 50% higher [than] those of traditional funds? And is it win-win for the planet when companies can game the system by selling a polluting plant to another company that is happy to be judged as a “sin” stock? [A] 2021 literature review of more than 1,100 peer reviewed studies and 27 published meta-analyses determined that the risk-adjusted financial performance of ESG investing was indistinguishable from conventional investing. Another study of American mutual funds between 2010 and 2018 found that companies in ESG investment portfolios violated more labor laws, paid more fines and had higher carbon emissions than those in non-ESG portfolios sold by the same institution.

As to DEI goals, Wooldridge finds the pursuit of equity is often just warmed-over envy and socialism, which regularly leads to absurd corporate policies that offend many workers, customers, and the public while damaging the corporate bottom line:

When it comes to equality, liberal capitalism is built on two great principles: procedural justice (equality of treatment before the law) and equality of opportunity. Liberal capitalists celebrate the fact that Jeff Bezos is filthy rich for a mixture of first principles (people should be free to exercise their talents) and utilitarianism (Amazon.com Inc. improves the general welfare by providing better services at better prices). But “equity” tries to substitute “fairness” for “equality of opportunity.” … “In order to truly be antiracist,” says Ibram X. Kendi, a leading guru of the social justice movement, “you also have to truly be anti-capitalist.” This emphasis on “equity” drives the DEI formula in an increasingly radical direction. The Coca-Cola Co. had to apologize for including on its company training platform an external LinkedIn presentation on confronting racism that urged viewers, “Try to be less white.” … Bank of America Corp. supported a “Racial Equity 21-Day Challenge” for its employees which argued that the United States is a system of “white supremacy.” Walmart Inc. has told workers that they are guilty of “internalized racial superiority.” The result of this combination of social justice radicalism and overpromising is that DEI programs are ineffective, or worse. Anti-bias training frequently activates stereotypes. …. Diversity training that vilifies whites produces resentment among whites, particularly when compared with diversity training that celebrates color blindness. The clunking machinery of DEI—the training videos, workshops and roleplaying exercises—also offends workers’ sense of autonomy and self-respect.

The push for ESG and DEI is producing a backlash among politicians, with numerous states passing or considering legislation to block “woke” banks and investment funds from managing state pension funds or doing business with the state.

“If the GOP retakes the majority in the upcoming midterm elections, it reportedly plans to investigate the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for its increasing ESG advocacy,” notes Wooldridge.

SOUTH CAROLINA, MISSOURI JOIN ESG COUNTERREVOLUTION

On October 18, Missouri became the latest state to make investment giant BlackRock pay for its woke ESG investment policies. Missouri State Treasurer Scott Fitzpatrick announced the state had pulled $500 million in state pension funds from management by the company.

Fitzpatrick told FOX Business the Missouri State Employees’ Retirement System (MOSERS) sold all public equities managed by BlackRock.

BlackRock is one of 273 signatories on the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, “a group that has committed to support the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius and to support investing aligned with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner,” reports Pensions & Investments.

“This is the right thing to do for Missouri state employees who rely on the assets managed by MOSERS for their retirement,” Fitzpatrick told FOX Business when he announced Missouri’s decision.

Missouri joins a growing number of states that have removed their pension funds from BlackRock, other fund management firms, and banks in response to their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives—primarily over their attempts to force the companies and pensions whose stocks they manage or hold to end support for fossil fuels and firearms and to promote elements of the leftist agenda such as critical race theory and LBGTQ indoctrination in schools.

On October 5, Louisiana’s Department of Treasury announced it had divested $794 million from BlackRock in response to the company’s net-zero commitments. Most recently, South Carolina Treasurer Curtis M. Loftis Jr. announced the state would divest an additional $200 million from BlackRock funds by the end of 2022.

“For the past five years, I have worked systematically to remove BlackRock managed funds from our state’s various investment portfolios,” Loftis said in an email announcing the move. “I realized early on that ESG … had the potential to seriously undermine our state’s economic model from one that values fiduciary responsibility and sound financial judgment to one that pushes the left-wing political agenda of ‘stakeholder capitalism.'”

Fitzpatrick noted he is obligated by law to ensure the state’s retirement funds and other assets are managed in a way that prioritizes maximizing returns for retirees and taxpayers, not advancing progressive political policies.

“Fiduciary duty must remain the top priority for investment managers—a duty some of them have abdicated in favor of forcing a left wing social and political agenda that has failed to succeed legislatively, on publicly traded companies,” said Fitzpatrick. “We should not allow asset managers such as BlackRock, who have demonstrated that they will prioritize advancing a woke political agenda above the financial interests of their customers, to continue speaking on behalf of the state of Missouri.”

Derek Kreifels, CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation, praised the Missouri decision. The foundation has worked with state treasurers in Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia over past year to stop their pension funds from being used for leftist political causes.

“Fitzpatrick is taking decisive action to protect the people of Missouri by divesting pension funds from BlackRock, who has weaponized ESG by pushing radical climate and social policies under the guise of an investment strategy,” Kreifels said when Fitzpatrick announced Missouri’s action. “BlackRock’s reckless agenda is robbing Americans of their retirement dollars and driving up costs from the gas pump to the grocery store.”

Who Benefits from U.S. Energy Policy?,Greg E. Walcher,"Spoiler Alert – not you.

Economist Stephen Moore has published a chart listing quarterly profits of America’s four largest technology firms. The numbers are unfathomable for mere mortals like us. Tesla earned $2.3 billion – that’s not total income, just profits (total income was over $30 billion). Profits were $6.7 billion for Meta (Facebook and Instagram), $19.4 billion for Apple, and $16.7 billion for Microsoft. That is just profits earned in the second quarter of this year, so multiply it by four and you see how rich some of these folks are getting.

As astonishing as those numbers are, though, all four of them combined made less money than Saudi Arabia’s main oil company, Saudi Aramco. Its profits exceeded $48 billion in that same quarter. As Moore wrote, “Saudi Arabia is loving life” these days. The U.S. government’s anti-fossil fuel policies have caused two significant problems for Americans. First, they have dramatically driven up the price of gasoline, home heating, and other energy costs. Second, they have made the economy more dependent once again on foreign energy sources, especially imported oil.

That has implications far beyond the prices we pay at the pump. It is spectacularly enriching Saudi Arabia, China, Russia, Iran, and other producing countries around the world, many of which are not allies. No rational person watching the belligerent behavior of those countries could conclude that sending them hundreds of billions of American dollars is a good idea.

This is a recent development, historically speaking. Oil was only discovered in Saudi Arabia in 1938, by Chevron, and it transformed the entire region after World War II. Before that, Saudis were mostly nomadic, tribal, and comparatively poor. The Saudi economy was bolstered mostly by tourism revenue from Muslim pilgrimages to Mecca. Today, oil generates over $150 billion a year for Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi royal family is the world’s wealthiest, with a net worth estimated at $1.4 trillion. The country is the world’s largest arms importer, spent $68 billion financing civil war in Yemen, and spends fortunes destabilizing Qatar, Egypt, Libya, and other parts of the Mid-East, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. A vast share of that money came from the U.S. over the past seven decades.

Whether anyone thinks this is smart policy on America’s part, it is reality. U.S. imports of foreign oil have gone from about 150 million barrels a month when President Biden took office to over 204 million last month, according to the Energy Information Administration. The numbers include 300,000 barrels a day from Saudi Arabia, which just decided to cut production to further drive up the price. They laughed when the American President publicly asked them not to do so.

It is beyond hypocritical for Biden to ask other countries not to reduce fossil fuel production, while waging war on production in his own country. But that is the world we seem to be living in today.

It doesn’t have to be this way. For decades federal energy policy ranged from Nixon urging everyone to turn down their thermostats, and Carter suggesting sweaters, to Obama’s attempt to bludgeon the energy industry out of business. The Trump approach instead sought “energy dominance,” and concentrated on lifting regulatory impediments. The result was astonishing, considering Trump was only president one term. By the end of his second year, Investor’s Business Daily reported that “Last week, the U.S. exported more oil than we imported, for the first time in 70-plus years.” It turns out all that was really needed was for government to get out of the way and let the marketplace work.

Government had long warned we were running out of oil, but instead, vast oil and gas reserves were discovered, and advanced technologies like directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing enabled competitive production of those resources. Domestic production skyrocketed, and imports steadily declined – not because of government policies, but despite them. By 2020, the U.S. became the world’s largest producer and exporter, even beginning to send oil and gas to Europe to replace Russian oil.

Biden reversed all that and the U.S. is already back to spending $700 billion annually to import oil. He drained the strategic petroleum reserve by 250 million barrels since he took office, and it now holds just over half its capacity, barely enough to supply 20 days of current U.S. demand during an emergency.

If Biden wanted to deliver the greatest “October Surprise” in the history of election years, he could simply announce a return to 2020 energy policies. Saudi Arabia would hate it, and he could laugh at them.","October 25, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/who-benefits-from-us-energy-policy/
Red Light – The Devil’s Playground,Greg E. Walcher,"An ancient expression says, “the idle mind is the devil’s playground.” When it comes to air pollution, it could be said about the idle car. Idling engines pollute the air.

A British consulting company, Cambustion, studied the use of gasoline by idling vehicles, with startling conclusions. Cars use more fuel, and emit more pollutants, idling for ten seconds than turning off and restarting the engine. Numerous other studies have confirmed that.

In response, British constables now issue hefty fines to drivers idling more than five minutes. Some U.S. states are following suit, Massachusetts threatening $25,000 fines for five-minute idling. A Canadian study (converting the original metric numbers) found that for every gallon of gasoline used, a vehicle produces 20 pounds of carbon dioxide.

EPA agrees that ten seconds of idling “uses more fuel and produces more emissions that contribute to smog and climate change than stopping and restarting your engine.” It estimates that idling vehicles in the U.S. waste six billion gallons of fuel annually, and that America’s 250 million personal vehicles generate 30 million tons of CO 2 a year while idling.

Unquestionably, traffic jams and congestion cause major emissions. It is all wasted, because unlike many other activities that produce pollution but also jobs and income, idling produces nothing of value – no movement, no economic activity.

Recommended solutions, in the U.S. and abroad, mostly include fining drivers for excessive idling, and encouraging people to shut off engines if not moving within seconds. EPA likes hybrid-electric vehicles that shut off when not moving, a stop-start technology now available on many new vehicles. And commercial vehicles can be equipped to provide power to accessories without the engine running.

These ideas might all help reduce idling, but notice they all have something else in common. They’re all about individual drivers and vehicle choices, as if government can do nothing, other than force particular behaviors. It’s a universal problem of government that it can never acknowledge its own role in creating problems. But as with many issues, government’s own choices exacerbate traffic congestion, most egregiously with traffic lights.

An intersection I navigate regularly has two traffic lights 100 yards apart, one at a busy interchange, the other at a parking lot, which never has more than two cars waiting. But the lights are out of sync, causing backups of 50-75 cars across three lanes every rush hour, making every driver wait at least twice at the same light, idling around three minutes. That’s an extreme example, but not uncommon. One study showed the lights at a single intersection in Los Angeles cost drivers collectively 1,260 hours every day idling, waiting for the green.

There are 350,000 intersections with traffic lights in the U.S., including over 100 in my hometown of Grand Junction, 1500 in Oakland, 12,460 in New York City, and over 13,000 in Denver. A Texas Transportation Institute survey revealed that U.S. drivers wasted 6.9 billion hours stuck in traffic, including traffic lights, a shocking 42 hours a year for the average rush-hour commuter. The cost was estimated at $160 billion in wasted time and fuel per year. A USA Today report put the annual national cost closer to $300 billion.

That doesn’t just hit our pocketbooks, but also the air we breathe. The National Association of City Transportation Officials recommends the perfect timing for a red light (hint: a few seconds less than it takes to send that text message). They recommend 60-90 seconds, meaning an urban driver averages 75 seconds at each red light, often when no cars are coming the other way. You can do the math, but the short version is that if you start driving when you’re 15 and stop when you’re 65, you will have spent almost four months sitting at stop lights.

Governments can change that dramatically, with existing technology that can leave the lights green if no cars are coming. Even in the 1950s, Grand Junction posted signs on 4th and 5th Streets telling motorists that the signals were set at 22 MPH, so drivers at that speed could make them all green. Today the city has at least a dozen traffic volume cameras, and Colorado now has 140 roundabouts, which completely eliminate traffic lights. Roundabouts slow traffic, but generally not to an idling stop.

Some cities link their lights to a central control center. Mesa, Arizona’s 400 signals are connected to a computerized system, where lights are synchronized, and timings adjusted, as traffic requires. Such technologies are shown to reduce congestion and emissions by 20 percent or more, but a Guidehouse Insights report says only seven percent of North America’s signalized intersections have “adaptive traffic-control technology.” It costs $20,000 or more per intersection to install such technology, but how much is cleaner air worth? How many billions have we already spent on clean air initiatives?

Incidentally, governments also spend millions installing speed bumps, even though the quick acceleration after drivers pass them also increases air pollution. Rapid acceleration and idling are the two worst contributors, and both could be alleviated with better traffic technology.

Compared with America’s massive investment in other technologies to reduce air pollution – $150 billion on wind energy in the last decade, for example – the cost of reduced idling, preventing millions of tons of greenhouse gases, is a bargain. Because traffic lights are never really “green.”","October 19, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/red-light-the-devils-playground/
"Climate Change Weekly #450: Climate Censors and Their Phony Fact Checks, Paid Shills",H. Sterling Burnett,"Climate alarmists’ response when the facts don’t fit the narrative they’ve been pushing for two decades is to suppress the facts by killing the messengers. Today you kill bearers of inconvenient truths not with an ax to the back of the neck but by de-platforming them.

The climate censors start by throttling or labelling posts with which they disagree, limiting others’ ability to share unredacted posts on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. If that fails to dissuade the climate realists from posting evidence-based claims pointing to an unalarming climate future, the social media giants remove their ability to monetize their online activities. If these first two attempts at censorship fail to force the realists to toe the party line or at least self-edit their climate posts, Big Tech applies the death penalty. The corporate censors ban them: first temporarily, then, if they repeat the offense of telling the truth, for life from one or all the major online social media platforms.

The largest social media companies are owned by a very few companies or individuals. Facebook/Meta, Instagram, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and TicTok are owned or controlled by less than half a dozen individuals—with the last-named suspected of being controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. These online platforms have become the de facto public square for discussion. They act as oligopolists or monopolists, and when competitors arise they quickly gobble them up.

In any other business endeavor, government regulators, primarily the Federal Trade Commission, would never have allowed many of the mergers that have taken place in the social media space. The companies would be broken up. After all, those few companies control a greater share of the social media market than Standard Oil controlled of the oil market before the government broke the company up.

It’s bad enough when big tech, with the help or encouragement of the federal government, censors political or social views its thought police consider offensive or socially unacceptable. It’s even worse for society when these multinational giants impose sanctions on people for speaking or pointing out truths, matters of fact, that undermine or inconveniently bring into question claims made by purported or self-appointed experts on matters that are far from “settled science.” Knowledge is advanced only when there is free debate over contested factual claims.

The suppression of facts the government and progressive activists didn’t want discussed or debated was all too evident during and after the Wuhan virus pandemic. Discussion of the virus’ origins was suppressed online as being offensive or racist, even though where or how a virus originates is a factual matter having nothing to do with race and the question was, and as far as I can ascertain still is, open to debate or discovery.

Worse still was the suppression and censorship of discussion of the efficacy of a variety of possible medical interventions to combat the virus, the effectiveness of the vaccines developed to prevent it, and the possible dangers of adverse reactions to the rapidly approved, little-studied vaccines. The judgements and decisions of thousands of medical professionals were censored or suppressed online even though many of the treatments they suggested seemed effective in ameliorating or at least suppressing the worst effects of the disease.

Time and experience have shown the concerns many doctors and researchers raised about whether the vaccines would prevent people from contracting the virus, as official government health authorities claimed they would, were accurate. Time and experience have also shown concerns about possible adverse reactions to the vaccines were also legitimate. The social media giants shamelessly suppressed these facts, with government encouragement, acting as arbiters of truth about the pandemic and responses to it.

During the pandemic, health professionals learned what scientists and analysts discussing climate change have long known: truth is no defense against censorship by Big Tech.

The case of Gregory Wrightstone, executive director of the CO2 Coalition, is instructive on this point. As detailed in posts on the CO2 Coalition blog and various news articles, Wrightstone and scientists associated with the coalition have been permanently banned from LinkedIn; had their posts throttled, censored, or banned by Facebook; and were prevented from even opening an account with Instagram. Wrightstone’s thoughtcrime was to point out that increasing carbon dioxide has the beneficial effect of boosting plant growth, including an increase in crop growth that has reduced hunger and malnutrition globally. Wrightstone and other scholars at the CO2 Coalition also had the temerity to point out many of the claims that climate change was making extreme weather events more intense or more common were refuted by official government data and the findings of the U.N’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These are indisputable facts. Yet because censors at social media giants “can’t handle the truth,” Wrightstone and the CO2 Coalition have been prevented from speaking in the modern public square about climate change.

There is evidence the corporate media are getting paid well to suppress climate facts. Earlier this year the Associated Press, supposedly an independent news organization, proudly announced it was receiving millions of dollars in funding from a group of climate-woke foundations to cover climate change more regularly and extensively.

“This far-reaching initiative will transform how we cover the climate story,” admitted AP senior vice president and executive editor Julie Pace in the press release announcing the grant program. I’ll bet!

“The media’s coverage of climate change has sunk to a new journalistic low,” said Climate Depot’s Mark Morano in commenting on AP’s announcement. “The mainstream media, led by the Associated Press, is now publicly admitting they are just phoning in their coverage on ‘climate change.'”

Recently, the same talking points on hurricanes popped up in multiple stories in the space of a couple of days across numerous supposedly independent media outlets. These “news” stories directly or in a more veiled fashion critiqued the tweets of Steve Milloy, founder and editor of JunkScience.com. Milloy’s exposés of flawed, mistaken, and outright fraudulent scientific claims have plagued promoters of environmental apocalypse scare stories since 1996.

It seems the AP, Agence France-Press (AFP), and other mainstream media outlets have finally had enough and are targeting Milloy in a coordinated fashion. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ian and the numerous stories wrongly linking it to climate change, Milloy tweeted on September 29, “No trend in landfalling Florida hurricanes since 1903,” “Not in frequency. Not in intensity. Not in anything. Climate is a hoax.”

Granted, “climate is a hoax” may have been over the top and the meaning unclear to some. Nonetheless, the AP, AFP, and others recognized Milloy’s tweet was a succinct and effective broadside against the claim Hurricane Ian was caused or made worse by climate change, and of the broader claim climate change is causing more frequent or severe hurricanes. The available data and peer-reviewed research cited in dozens of Climate Realism and Climate Change Weekly posts prove Milloy’s claims are accurate. The facts are on his side. Even as the planet has modestly warmed, hurricanes have neither increased in number nor become more powerful. Some data even suggests hurricane numbers may be trending downwards. These are easily confirmed facts.

Facts about hurricanes didn’t seem important to the AP and AFP when they carried out their so-called fact checks of Milloy’s tweets. Instead of providing the hurricane data or even what the most recent report by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had to say about hurricanes, the dubious journalists quoted select experts, cited anecdotes, and rapidly ginned up “attribution” research to assert Milloy’s claims were false or misleading.

The evidence clearly shows those attacking Milloy’s tweets are the ones misleading the public. The data proves it. What reason, then, could corporate media outlets have for ignoring facts about hurricanes in order to smear the claims of a single analyst if not to signal Big Brother social media climate censors to ban him from their platforms?

The treatment of legitimate scientific debate and the suppression of facts about climate change by scientific journals, the big corporate media, and social media moguls represents a nadir of public discourse perhaps not seen since the days of Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union and, before that, the Catholic Church’s prosecution of Galileo. All we can do is hope social media giants will not ban Milloy or others like him.

It would be better if those media giants were to reconsider their guidelines for moderating speech across their platforms and perhaps end their factchecking functions entirely. One has to opt in voluntarily to receive any individual’s or group’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or LinkedIn posts. They are not sent unbidden. If you link to, friend, or follow a person whose subsequent posts offend you, you can easily unfollow, unfriend, or drop them from your list of contacts. Alternatively or in addition, you can respond to the post across social media platforms with your own point of view or factual claims and explain why the initial statement is misleading, wrongheaded, or false—and perhaps receive merited criticism by interested parties.

In his justly praised book On Liberty, John Stuart Mill wrote,

“If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.

“The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.

“Every man who says frankly and fully what he thinks is so far doing a public service. We should be grateful to him for attacking most unsparingly our most cherished opinions.”

Social media moguls claim to want to make it easy for people to exchange thoughts and ideas. They publicize their platforms as a way to make that possible. They should take Mill’s words to heart when considering suppression of communications, especially when the posts are critical of assertions by persons claiming to have the exclusive authority to speak for “the science” or when the narrative critiqued is being pushed by government. Do the world a service: allow people to speak and exchange ideas freely and be refuted, not silenced, if they are wrong.

Wrightstone, Milloy, and other climate realists who have been de-platformed or threatened with expulsion are right, and the so-called consensus view is wrong. I’m not saying that: the data do.

HUMAN-CAUSED CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT CAUSING THE LARSEN-C ICE SHELF COLLAPSE

A recent study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres (JGRA) explodes the myth that climate change is driving the decline of Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf, the largest remaining ice shelf on the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula.

A group of scientists, primarily but not solely associated with the British Antarctic Survey, examined 20 years of data covering a variety of climatological and weather patterns affecting the region. In a hindcasting exercise, they ran the data through a high-resolution climate model used by the U.K. Met office, to “evaluate the contribution of various atmospheric conditions in order to identify and rank, for the first time, the most significant causes of melting over the recent past.”

In order of importance, the four main drivers of Larsen C surface melting are:

1. Shortwave solar radiation.

2. Foehn wind variations.

3. Cloud cover changes.

4. Natural circulation ocean current variations (Southern Annular Mode, El Niño–Southern Oscillation).

The evidence indicates these four “melt drivers interact with one another and can compound or dampen the effects of other causes of melting,” the study states.

“Neither anthropogenic forcing nor CO2 emissions are listed as causal factors in Antarctic ice melt processes,” writes No Trick Zone, one of the few websites or media outlets to cover the study.

Further reinforcing the evidence human-caused climate change is not a significant contributing factor in the waxing and waning of Larsen C is research cited by No Tricks Zone indicating “until 1000 to 2000 years ago, Antarctica was up to 5°C warmer than it is presently [with] open-water conditions prevail[ing] throughout most of the Holocene (the last 11,700 years) in the same area where the massive Larsen Ice Shelf exists today.”

If the researchers involved in the JGRA study are correct, the four factors they’ve identified could “cause this ice shelf to collapse, and therefore indirectly contribute to sea level rise,” with no help from anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions.

This Subsidy May Not Cost Much,Greg E. Walcher,"When California passed legislation banning the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, and 17 states legally follow California standards, many observers questioned the practicality of the lofty goal. There are not enough electric cars made in the world to replace California’s 30 million cars, nor the batteries, charging stations, or disposal facilities.

That gets to the heart of the debate about electric vehicle subsidies, a debate with an ironic history. Congress created the subsidy – a $7500 tax credit for electric car buyers – with good intentions, namely, an attempt to bolster a fledgling industry so it could become competitive with Ford, GM, and Toyota.

Here is the irony. Congress enacted the subsidy with the proviso that once a manufacturer was large enough to compete, the tax credit would go away. That success was determined by a 200,000-vehicle limit. Once a company sold that many cars, it was deemed competitive, no longer in need of subsidies. But what happened when one company took advantage of the incentive, spent millions to gear up production, and broke into the market? Tesla became a major success story, the subsidy clearly accomplishing its purpose. The company has sold nearly two million electric cars, now earns over $30 billion in annual revenue, its cars no longer eligible for the subsidy.

However, once Tesla proved there is a market for subsidized electric vehicles, all the other manufacturers then decided to get in the game, none of whom had yet sold 200,000 electric cars. So, the tax credit became a subsidy for Ford, GM, Toyota and other major manufacturers – but not Tesla. And Tesla wound up lobbying to change the very law to which it owed its success, at least partly.

Then came California’s activism, and the Biden Administration’s dogged determination to force Americans to buy electric vehicles. Obviously, the original tax credit law needed updating to reflect the new reality – that every major car maker in the world now produces electric vehicles.

Never willing to terminate any government program, Congress acted decisively to keep this one. The recently passed climate bill, comically titled the “Inflation Reduction Act” significantly changed the electric vehicle tax credit program, including repealing the 200,000-vehicle limit, so Tesla can once again take advantage of the subsidy for which it no longer qualified under the original law. CNN said the new law “will have big implications for electric vehicle buyers” and many conservatives decried the massive price tag of all those tax credit subsidies. Both sides jump to premature conclusions.

Some Tesla models may become technically eligible for the tax credit once again, but hundreds of other cars that were eligible before will no longer be. That is because of the work of West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, always concerned about the impact of foreign mining and minerals on his state’s mining industry and the thousands of jobs it supports.

During negotiations on the legislation, Manchin insisted on limiting the subsidy to cars built in North America with minerals mined, processed, or recycled in North America. That’s a problem for all electric vehicle manufacturers. The Associated Press estimated that at least 50 of the 72 electric or hybrid models now on the market fail that test, but that report is way off. In truth, virtually none of them qualify. John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, posted a blog predicting that “no vehicles will qualify for this purchase over the next few years.”

The bill also limits the price of eligible vehicles to $80,000. So, one might use the credit to buy a Chevy Bolt or electric Mustang (but not a Tesla Model S or a Lucid Air), though for the time being none of them meet all the made-in-America requirements.

Chevy Bolt starts at under $30,000, but uses batteries made in China. A 240-volt plug can be installed for about $5,000 and will add 26 miles of range for every hour of charging time.

Of the dozen lowest-prices electric vehicles available, only two are American, but both the Mustang Mach-E and Chevy Bolt use batteries made in China. It is estimated that roughly 75 percent of electric cars in the world use batteries that are at least partly made in China, as are many other car parts. The new law places significant restrictions on the assembly, batteries, and supply chains – and the income of eligible buyers. Specifically, vehicle assembly, battery components and battery minerals production must be in North America. Beginning in 2023, 40 percent of the critical minerals used must be mined in the U.S., or a country with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement (Mexico or Canada). That number rises to 80 percent by 2027 and 100 percent in 2029. If there are ever enough electric cars for sale to meet California’s all-electric goal, it will not be because of these federal tax credits.

All my conservative friends may not need to worry so much about the outrageous cost of the electric vehicle subsidies. With virtually no cars meeting the requirements, it may not cost taxpayers anything at all.

Once Congress figures that out, watch for leaders to roll Joe Manchin again and repeal the made-in-America requirements. Which do we think they care more about – protecting mining jobs in West Virginia, or selling electric vehicles in California?","October 11, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/this-subsidy-may-not-cost-much/
"In Memoriam: Timothy Ball, Ph.D., Fierce Defender of Science",H. Sterling Burnett,"Timothy Ball, Ph.D. passed away on September 24. I’m truly sorry to have to write this. I had few personal encounters with Dr. Ball, unfortunately: a couple of phone interviews, some email exchanges, and brief hellos exchanged in passing at meetings we both attended.

Although I didn’t know him well, I followed and admired his work for years. Dr. Ball was a fighter for the use of the scientific method to explore the world and discover truth in all areas of science. In his last few decades he was perhaps best-known for doggedly using the scientific method in academia, in the popular media, and in court to expose the pseudo-science used to promote climate alarm. For his efforts, Ball received praise in the form of multiple awards, and he was sued by noted climate alarmist Michael Mann, Ph.D., of hockey stick infamy. (More on this later.)

Among the awards Dr. Ball received were the Clarence Atchison Award for Excellence in Community Service, the Clifford J. Robson Memorial Award for Teaching Excellence; and the Lifetime Achievement in Climate Science award by The Heartland Institute at the 13th International Conference on Climate Change in 2019. In a follow-up to his receipt of the latter award, I interviewed Dr. Ball for an article published in Environment & Climate News.

Below are a short bio of Dr. Ball; a brief remembrance by Joe Bast, former long-time president of The Heartland Institute; and excerpts of a post from the Manhattan Contrarian blog discussing the court case for which Ball is perhaps most famous.

Brief biography, Timothy Ball, Ph.D.

Dr. Timothy Ball received a bachelor’s degree with honors in geography from the University of Winnipeg in 1970, followed by an M.A. from the University of Manitoba in 1971 and a Ph.D. in geography with a focus on historical climatology from Queen Mary University of London, England in 1983. His dissertation was titled, “Climatic Change in Central Canada : A Preliminary Analysis of Weather Information from the Hudson’s Bay Company Forts at York Factory and Churchill Factory, 1714-1850.”

Dr. Ball joined the University of Winnipeg faculty in 1971, retiring as a full professor in 1996. Ball then served as chief science advisor to the International Climate Science Coalition and a policy advisor to The Heartland Institute.

Dr. Ball was a researcher and author of scientific papers on a range of environmental issues, including a coauthored paper in the scientific journal Ecological Complexity titled “Polar bears of western Hudson Bay and climate change: Are warming spring air temperatures the ‘ultimate’ survival control factor?”

Ball was one of several authors of Slaying the Sky Dragon: Death of the Greenhouse Gas Theory, published in 2011. In 2014 Ball wrote the book The Deliberate Corruption of Climate Science. Ball’s most recent solo effort discussing climate change is Human Caused Global Warming, with the attention-grabbing subtitle “The Biggest Deception in Human History.”

As one can see from the titles of Dr. Ball’s books, he was not one to hide his true thoughts or shy away from controversy or an academic or, as it turns out, a legal fight.

From Joe Bast:

Tim Ball, Ph.D., was part of the first generation of modern climatologists trained to understand and study Earth’s climate “in the round” rather than just one or a few aspects of it. He had the misfortune of watching his discipline succumb to the temptations of government funding, media attention, and specialization that have caused so much damage climate science and to other scientific disciplines.

Dr. Ball bravely and loudly called out the politicization of science, the substitution of climate models for genuine climatology, and the terrible real-world consequences of the policies advocated by climate alarmists. He taught thousands of students to see past the headlines and declarations of political entities such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and to focus instead on the real science of weather patterns.

Dr. Ball liked to say climate change “is a puzzle of thousands of pieces; climate science is [only] one piece of the puzzle.” Computer modelers, physicists, botanists, geologists, and economists, to name just a few of the academic disciplines that claim to have insights into the causes and consequences of climate change, typically lack the training to understand the dynamics of the climate system. At best they can shed light one small pieces of the climate puzzle. Dr. Ball frequently said they should never be trusted to declare “the science is settled,” much less pontificate on what public policies ought to be pursued.

Despite fierce and often highly personal criticism from all corners of the climate alarmist industry, Dr. Ball never lost his composure or tailored his speech or writing. He was the IPCC’s strongest and one of its most credible critics. He was generous with his insights and advice to me and to two or even three generations of other policy analysts who sought him out. He will be sorely missed.

For all his stellar work, Ball is perhaps best-known for his trenchant critique of Michael Mann’s widely disputed “hockey stick” reconstruction of the Earth’s recent temperature history and the hiding of the data Mann and his colleagues used to develop the widely cited graphic. Ball’s critique resulted in him being sued for libel by Mann. Frances Menton of the Manhattan Contrarian described the lawsuit well, including Ball’s ultimate vindication. I excerpt his comments here:

Ball was that rarity of a climate scientist in the world of academia with the temerity and courage to say and repeat that CO2 is a beneficial gas. He would not back down, in a world that rapidly went insane and became increasingly intolerant and hostile to his position. Notably, Ball did not shy away from calling out the biggest scamsters of the climate hustle, most particularly one Michael Mann. Mann is the professor at Penn State who was the lead creator of the IPCC’s iconic “hockey stick” graph that has been used to sell global warming hysteria to the world for the last 20+ years.

This post will draw substantially on a previous post I wrote back in 2019 titled “Michael Mann Hockey Stick Update: Now Definitively Established To Be Fraud.” That post goes into extensive detail on a lawsuit between Mann and Ball that ultimately ended in total victory for Ball. Here is an abbreviated version of the story of the Mann/Ball litigation, excerpted from that post:

[In 2011 a] prominent skeptical climate scientist in Canada named Tim Ball accused Mann of fraud in generating the Hockey Stick graph. The famous quote, from a February 2011 interview of Ball, was “Michael Mann should be in the State Pen, not Penn State.” In March 2011, Mann sued Ball for libel, focusing on that quote, in the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Vancouver. Here is a copy of the Complaint. … The case then essentially disappeared into limbo for eight-plus years. But on [August 23, 2019] the British Columbia court dismissed Mann’s claim with prejudice, and also awarded court costs to Ball.

Ball’s accusation against Mann was solidly based on the work of Canadian mathematician Steve McIntyre in attempting to reconstruct the Hockey Stick graph, and also on the so-called ClimateGate emails, released from the University of East Anglia (collaborators of Mann) in 2009. McIntyre conclusively demonstrated, based on disclosures in the ClimateGate emails, that Mann had truncated data in generating the Hockey Stick in order to achieve the presentation that he wanted. But throughout the process of McIntyre trying to reconstruct his work, Mann flatly refused to share the data and methods that he had used to generate the graph.

And then, even after suing Ball in British Columbia, Mann continued his refusal to produce his underlying data. That’s not something that a litigant can get away with. … From the 2019 post:

Mann absolutely refused to provide the underlying information in the Ball litigation. … The court repeatedly tried to get an agreement that something would be produced that would satisfy Ball, and repeatedly gave Mann more time to comply. Could this really go on for eight years? In the U.S., that would be extraordinary, but not impossible. . . . [I]n 2017 Mann actually agreed (under court pressure) to produce to Ball within 21 days the key technical information about construction of the Hockey Stick graph that Ball was requesting. But the information was not produced. … [F]inally seeking the dismissal of Mann’s claims as the ultimate sanction. On Friday [August 23, 2019], the court granted that relief.

Thus Ball was fully vindicated in the end by the court. …

In Canada, a loser in court is required to pay the fees and costs of the winner. Ball was awarded the fees and costs in an oral ruling by the court. …

Mann’s lawyer (McConchie) did not even oppose the application for costs, since that is the norm in Canadian litigation. But, in an event that will probably surprise no one, it turns out that in the intervening three years the execrable Mann has never paid anything to Ball. Ball was essentially wiped out financially by the costs of the litigation, to the extent that a GoFundMe has now been started by Anthony Watts to help his family pay for funeral expenses. Follow this link if you would like to contribute.

Tim Ball’s death is a loss to the community of climate realists: people who still believe that data and evidence should trump a good story, an elegant but unsupported theory, and complex but flawed computer model outputs when it comes to describing the state of the climate and whether a changing climate poses a dire threat to humanity and to nature. His passing is also a loss to the public, leaving us with one less champion for the pursuit of truth through faithful adherence to the scientific method, and one less defender of the benefits society receives from the use of fossil fuels.

MORE RESEARCH CONFIRMS CLIMATE MODELS RUN TOO HOT, EXPECTED WARMING IS NOT ALARMING

Two peer-reviewed papers from 2022 confirm what previous research has shown and IPCC modelers admit: climate model projections of temperatures run too hot. Because the findings are not alarming, these studies have received little media attention.

In a study published in Climate Dynamics, Nicholas Lewis uses a Bayesian method of statistical analysis to estimate “climate sensitivity” to a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from preindustrial levels, and its effect on temperatures. Bayesian analysis combines prior information about a phenomenon and established parameters to assign probabilities to a future range of events. The result of this analysis, as described by the author:

The resulting estimates of long-term climate sensitivity are much lower and better constrained (median 2.16°C, 17–83% range 1.75–2.7°C, 5–95% range 1.55–3.2°C) than in Sherwood et al. and in AR6 (central value 3°C, very likely range 2.0–5.0°C). This sensitivity to the assumptions employed implies that climate sensitivity remains difficult to ascertain, and that values between 1.5°C and 2°C are quite plausible. [Emphasis added.]

A study published in Geophysical Research Letters compares the simulated outputs of 38 widely used climate models under low, medium, and high climate sensitivity estimates, with the ERA5 dataset for 1980 through 2021 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The ERA5 dataset provides hourly estimates of numerous atmospheric, land, and oceanic climate variables.

The author found climate models that assume high or medium climate sensitivity produce results inconsistent with global temperature and climate data. The models’ temperature projections are far too high. As a result, the author concludes the models “should not be used for implementing policies based on their scenario forecasts.”

Although climate models with built-in low climate sensitivity perform better, producing results that more closely correspond with the measured data, they too are unsatisfactory because the results run too hot. If policymakers use the low-sensitivity models even though they are “not optimal,” they should not be stampeded into making bad energy policy decisions: the models’ simulated outputs are for a modest, quite “unalarming” warming for the next few decades.

One wonders how many studies must show climate models are seriously flawed, or how many times modelers must grudgingly admit their models don’t accurately simulate the climate, before the IPCC and the media admit governments should not use their projections of future climate conditions in setting energy and environmental policies.

The Coming Green Electricity Nightmare,Paul Driessen,"Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) wanted regulatory reform, in part to reverse some of the Biden Administration reversals of Trump era reforms intended to expedite permits for fossil fuel projects.

Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) needed Manchin’s vote in the 50-50 Senate to enact his latest spending extravaganza, the Inflation Reduction Act, which was primarily a massive climate and “green” energy subsidy arrangement. It gives Schumer allies some $370 billion in wind, solar, battery and other funding, tax credits and subsidies. In exchange, Schumer would offer a path for Manchin’s reform bill.

Manchin voted YEA, and promptly got bushwhacked. Once he’d helped enact the IRA, he had zero leverage. Schumer, he discovered, had promised an opportunity, maybe a vote, but not actual support. House and Senate members told him, we weren’t part of your secret negotiations with Schumer; we didn’t shake hands on any deal; we don’t want easier permitting for drilling, pipelines and LNG terminals that could help send US natural gas to Britain and Europe.

In the end, it’s probably a good thing Manchin’s bill went nowhere.

Yes, it provided some much needed and long overdue reforms to curb the paralysis by analysis and endless litigation that have plagued fossil fuel, highway, airport and countless other projects for decades.

But it also had Trojan horse provisions that would have unleashed hordes of newly subsidized wind, solar and transmission marauders on much of the Lower 48 USA, to send pseudo-clean electricity to mostly Democrat cities and states that don’t want even “renewable” power generation in their own backyards.

As the Wall Street Journal and energy analyst Robert Bryce observed, Manchin’s “reforms” would give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and other bureaucrats the power to issue permits and force multiple states to acquiesce to new transmission lines and 200-foot-tall towers across their scenic, habitat, agricultural and even residential lands – if the feds decide the lines are in the “national interest.” This could easily transform into federal powers of eminent domain, to take the needed acreage.

The feds could decree that thousands of miles of new transmission lines are in the “national interest” if, for instance, the lines “enhance the ability” of faraway wind and solar facilities to connect their intermittent, weather-dependent energy to an electric grid; or enable distant blue states to reach their renewable energy goals; or help achieve Biden Administration goals of stopping manmade climate change, “advancing environmental justice” and having “a net-zero economy” by 2050. Hopefully while avoiding blackout-a-week nightmares.

Populous states like New York could also work with FERC & Co. to have offshore wind turbines installed off less populated coasts, like Maine or North Carolina – and have the electricity delivered to the Empire State. New York’s peak summertime needs alone would require 2,500 monstrous 680-foot-tall 12-MW offshore turbines, operating 24/7 – when we’d be lucky if they generated electricity 40% of the year. (Imagine how many offshore … or 6-MW onshore … turbines we’d need to power the entire USA.)

Compounding the energy colonialism, the Manchin reform package would also give FERC authority to allocate and “socialize” transmission line costs, so that residents of states that don’t even get any of the electricity being sent along the newly imposed transmission lines would still have to help pay for them.

In short, the feds would be able to ride roughshod over states, local communities and federalism.

Let me say it again: Wind and sunshine are free, clean, green, renewable and sustainable. But harnessing this diffuse, unreliable, weather-dependent energy to power civilization definitely is not. And every bit of “renewable” power must be backed up with other power – so double our cash and material investments.

The Green Lobby and its legislator and regulator friends really seem to think they can just pass laws and earmark subsidies, demanding energy transformations by 2050 – and it will just happen. The raw materials will just be there, perhaps with a little MAGIC: Materials Acquisition for Global Industrial Change. That is, they simply assume the necessary raw materials will also just be there.

Not one of these luminaries has given a moment’s thought to – much less attempted to calculate – what this net-zero transition would require:

How many millions of wind turbines, billions of solar panels, billions of EV and backup batteries, millions of transformers, thousands of miles of transmission lines – sprawling across how many millions of acres of wildlife habitat, scenic and agricultural lands, and people’s once-placid backyards?

How many billions of tons of copper, steel, aluminum, nickel, cobalt, lithium, concrete, rare earths, composite plastics and other materials? How many trillions of tons of ores and overburden? How many mines, across how many more acres – with how much fossil fuel energy to operate the enormous mining equipment, and how much toxic air and water pollution emitted in the process? Where will it be done?

To cite just one example, just those 2,500 wind turbines for New York electricity (30,000 megawatts) would require nearly 110,000 tons of copper – which would require mining, crushing, processing and refining 25 million tons of copper ore … after removing some 40 million tons of overlying rock to reach the ore bodies. Multiply that times 50 states – and the entire world – plus transmission lines.

How many processing plants and factories would be needed? How much fossil fuel power to run those massive operations? How many thousands of square miles of toxic waste pits all over world under zero to minimal environmental standards, workplace safety standards, child and slave labor rules?

How many dead birds, bats, and endangered and other species would be killed off all across the USA and world – from mineral extraction activities, wind turbine blades, solar panels blanketing thousands of square miles of wildlife habitats, and transmission lines impacting still more land?

How many will survive hurricanes like Ian or Andrew? Where will we dump the green energy trash?

Not only do the luminaries and activists ignore these issues and refuse to address them. They actively suppress, cancel, censor and deplatform any questions and discussions about them. They collude with Big Tech companies and news agencies, which too often seem all too happy to assist.

The hard reality is, there are not, will not be, and cannot be, enough mines, metals and minerals on the entire planet – to reach any “net-zero” US economy by 2050, much less a global “green” economy.

Here’s another issue: electric vehicle and backup lithium-ion battery modules can erupt spontaneously into chemical-fueled infernos that cannot be extinguished by conventional fire-fighting means. That raises an important analog to rules Alec Baldwin should have kept uppermost in mind a year ago. Treat every firearm as if it is loaded. Never point your muzzle at anything you are not prepared to destroy.

In the Biden-Newsom-Kerry-IPCC energy arena: Treat every electric vehicle and backup battery system as if it is loaded and ready to ignite. Never park an EV, install a PowerWall or locate a backup power facility near anything you are not prepared to destroy.

That includes in your garage; near other vehicles; in parking garages under apartment and office buildings; in residential neighborhoods and highway tunnels; or on cargo ships like the Felicity Ace.

And yet we’re supposed to go along with Green Energy schemes – as we did with masks, school lockdowns and vaccinations to stop Covid – because our government, media and “public interest” groups insist that we “follow the science,” on which there can be no doubt (certainly none permitted) that we face a “manmade climate crisis” that threatens the very existence of humanity and “the only Earth we have.”

Because we have to destroy the planet (with green energy) in order to save it (from climate change).

It’s time to short-circuit this electricity nightmare, by asking these questions, demanding answers, and ending the notion that governments can simply issue edicts and compel reality to change in response.","October 5, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/the-coming-green-electricity-nightmare/
California Governor Newsom is just getting started with more green energy skyrocketing prices,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","California Governor Newsom became further convinced that voters continue to support his bizarre energy policies when they defeated the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election on September 14, 2021, thus keeping the incumbent elected for the term January 2019 to January 2023.

With California having the highest prices for fuel in the nation, the highest poverty and homeless rates, and barely able keep the lights on as its climate policies bite the electric grid, Governor Gavin Newsom is undaunted. With his ego at an all-time high, on Friday September 23rd he signed at least 40 new climate bills to ramp up California’s green-energy shock experiment onto the same citizens that defeated the recall.

Newsom does not realize that wind turbines and solar panels CANNOT manufacture anything for society.

The reasons why subsidized wind and solar electricity are not replacing fossil fuels, is that they can only generate electricity intermittently from breezes and sunshine. When we look at Newsom’s pledge for an all-electric world, it is obvious that Newsom remains oblivious to the reality that everything that needs electricity is made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

Newsom has short memories of world populating from 1 to 8 billion in less than two hundred years. Newsom, like Biden, has no “replacement” for oil, just a delusion that intermittent electricity can replace oil.

California, which has been closing continuous uninterruptible electricity generation from natural gas and nuclear plants for years, has forced the state to import over 30 percent of its electricity from other states. This has made California the nation’s largest net electrical-importing state by a wide margin. By 2050, state consultants estimate that electrification mandates, including those for cars and trucks, will cause total demand to skyrocket, with some estimates of demand rising 60 to 90 percent by that time, hoping that adjoining states will have the extra power.

California, a state that was virtually independent of imported crude oil from foreign countries in 1995, today California is the only state in contiguous America that imports oil, now at more than 60 percent of the needs of the fifth largest economy in the world.

At today’s price of crude oil around $90 per barrel the imported crude oil costs California more than $150 million dollars a day, yes, every day, being paid to oil-rich foreign countries, depriving Californians of jobs and business opportunities, and drivers to pay premium prices for fuel.

Even with that huge cost burden to the state, Newsom continuously seeks further reductions of in-state production that will place greater dependency on foreign countries, with significant less environmental controls than California, and further increasing the daily cost to the state to meet the demands of its economy.

Newsom believes that an all-renewable electricity system from unreliable weather conditions, WITHOUT the products and fuels from fossil fuels, can work to support a modern economy.

All parts for renewables are all manufactured from crude oil. These manufactured items from oil did not exist before 1900. Ridding the world of crude oil would eliminate wind turbines, solar panels, and vehicles!

In Newsom’s all-electric world, Newsom believes that the products and fuels manufactured from fossil fuels, which are supporting infrastructures, lifestyles, and economies, which did not exist before 1900, are dangerous and polluting and is causing dangerous climate change.

In Newsom’s all-electric world, Newsom believes that all the infrastructures developed in less than two centuries, from the products manufactured from crude oil, are NOT needed by future societies, such as medical, electronics, communications, and the many transportation infrastructures such as airlines, merchant ships, automobiles, trucks, military, and the space programs.

Those with a passion to rid the world of crude oil are oblivious to the fact that crude oil is virtually useless, until it is manufactured (refineries) into something usable. Those oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil are the basis of more than 6,000 products in our daily lives that did not exist before the 1900’s, and the fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of aircraft for military, commercial, private and the President’s Air Force One, and merchant ships, and the military and the space programs.

These are a sampling of a few items that will not be available from the breezes and sunshine that generates intermittent electricity:

Fuels for the:

50,000 heavy-weight and long-range merchant ships that are moving products throughout the world.

50,000 heavy-weight and long-range jets used by commercial airlines, private usage, and the military.

The 290 million registered vehicles in the U.S. as of 2021, that were comprised of about 56 percent trucks, 40 percent cars, and 4 percent motorcycles.

The cruise ships that now move twenty-five million passengers around the world.

The space program.

Oil derivatives to make thousands of products such as:

Tires for the billions of vehicles.

Asphalt for the millions of miles of roadways.

Medications and medical equipment.

Vaccines.

Communications systems, including cell phones, computers, iPhones, and iPads.

Water filtration systems.

Sanitation systems.

Fertilizers that come from natural gas to help feed billions.

Pesticides to control locusts and other pests.

Wind turbines and solar panels as they are all made with products from fossil fuels.

Efforts to cease the use of crude oil will be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change, and lead the world to an era of guaranteed extreme shortages of fossil fuel products like we had in the decarbonized world in the 1800’s.

Climate change may impact humanity but being mandated to live without the products manufactured from oil, will necessitate lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s and could only lead us back to shorter life spans, diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths resulting from the elimination of fossil fuels that are benefiting society.

Life Without Oil is NOT AS SIMPLE AS NEWSOM MAY THINK as renewable energy is only intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine and NEITHER wind turbines, nor solar panels, can manufacture products or fuels for society.

While renewables continue to underperform in the generation of electricity, subsidies continue for wind and solar power plants based on “nameplate ratings”.

Wind and solar should be penalized when they cannot deliver that for which they have been permitted. And while Newsom promotes the “nameplate farce” of wind and solar, crude oil continues to be targeted for elimination along with coal and natural gas, even though oil is seldom used for generating electricity.

The unintended consequences of Newsom attempting to rid California and the world of crude oil usage are being realized in supply shortages and soaring prices. The elimination of products and fuels manufactured from crude oil will impose shortages and inflation in perpetuity for all California residents, inclusive of the same residents that defeated the recall of Newsom in 2021.

California’s Unlimited Water Supply,Greg E. Walcher,"None of my columns have ever generated as many emails and phone calls as the recent series about the Colorado River, draining Lake Powell, and California’s abuse of its entitled share. When the Bureau of Reclamation decided to give that state a complete pass, instead cutting supplies yet again for Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico, many concluded that neither the Bureau nor California are serious about solutions.

We all understand the drought has affected the entire West, creating water shortages in every state, and drastically lowering water levels in reservoirs. But in the Colorado River water debates, California has always had an advantage over the other states – 840 miles of coastline on the Earth’s largest body of water. At least half of the people I heard from asked the simple question, why can’t they use the Pacific Ocean?

People cannot drink saltwater, obviously, but saltwater can be turned into freshwater. The process is called “desalination,” and a growing chorus of people insist that California spend some of its vast resources investing in that technology, to end to the otherwise endless battles over the Colorado River.

Observers took heart last month when Governor Gavin Newsom unveiled a new water plan for his state. It includes 4 million acre-feet of new storage; 1.3 million acre-feet of reuse, recycling, and conservation; and “making new water available for use by… desalinating ocean water and salty water in groundwater basins.” Finally, the state plans to take advantage of its ocean, as others have been advising for decades.

Sadly, the plan is long on goals but short on specifics. It calls for new reservoir storage but identifies projects that would store far less than the stated goal. It claims to protect existing water rights but says the state will “consider adopting regulations that would allow for curtailments of water rights in years when there is not a declared drought emergency.” Most disappointing, it names no specific desalination project, but asks water agencies to identify those with potential, so the state can “consider investing in grants” – to local governments, not desalination companies. But the provision bordering on outright falsehood is this gem: The water agency “will continue to guide research investments towards technological breakthroughs that solve California desalination challenges.”

Are they kidding? There is no technological barrier to California using the ocean to supply all its water, no “breakthrough” needed. They may have a problem with political will, but they do not have a problem with science.

That matters because we have seen, recently, how Californians react to desalination projects. In May, the California Coastal Commission, bowing to public opposition, unanimously voted down a desalination plant in Huntington Beach that was over 20 years in the planning. Its owner, Poseidon Water, has a track record with a similar-sized plant it operates in San Diego, producing nearly 50 million gallons a day and serving 400,000 people, at a cost of half a penny a gallon. There are 14 miniscule desalination plants in California, all of which combined produce barely 89,000 acre-feet of water a year. That’s a tenth of the water Blue Mesa Reservoir holds.

California’s only issue is cost. It is cheaper to take water from Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado, and to drain Lakes Powell and Mead, than to purify ocean water. But technological breakthroughs? That horse left the barn decades ago. There are over 18,000 desalination plants all over the world, providing water for 300 million people – nearly ten times the population of California.

Australia has six major plants producing the equivalent of 400 million gallons a day. A new plant just commissioned in the UAE already supplies 100 million gallons per day and will double by the end of the year. Israel produces half a billion gallons a day at five major desalination plants, and two more are being built. There are huge plants operating in Kuwait, Qatar, Libya, Algeria, and Bahrain.

The concept is not new or unproven, whatever West Coast politicians think. Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest country with no river, pioneered the technology in the 1950s out of necessity. Today it is the world’s leading desalinated water producer, generating almost seven billion gallons daily, 60 percent of the entire country’s water. Maybe it’s expensive, but it’s hard to be sympathetic to California’s “desalination challenges.” The state has the world’s fifth largest economy, with a GDP of $2.6 trillion, larger than any of the above countries.

Newsom said, “As California becomes hotter and drier, we must become more resourceful with the strategic opportunity… to build water resilience.” Build resilience? How about using your enviable unlimited supply to create total water independence?","October 5, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/californias-unlimited-water-supply/
Proposed Virginia Wind Facility Threatens Endangered Whales,H. Sterling Burnett,"North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW) are majestic giants of the seas. They are the subject of documentaries, scientific research and interest, and popular whale-watching tours. All this, and the whales themselves, could be coming to an end soon, and Democrats, including the Biden administration, are to blame.

There are only approximately 300 NARWs alive today. Various federal laws are supposed to protect the whales. The Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, for example, forbid activities that take, seriously harm, or harass the whales or force them out of their critical habitat. If the state of Virginia, Dominion Energy, and the Biden administration have their way, however, NARWs could soon be no more.

The proposed Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project is directly in the NARWs’ annual migration path. Dominion Energy has applied to erect 176 wind turbines, covering an area of approximately 10 miles by 15 miles—equal to the size of 85,000 football fields or the city of Tampa, Florida—located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. Each turbine will sit atop a monopole extending a minimum of 80 feet into the water and about 120 feet into the ocean floor, and its height above the water will top 620 feet. That’s higher than the Washington Monument, which is 555 feet tall.

Fortunately for the whales, a coalition of public interest groups is working to prevent the Biden administration and Democrats in states along the U.S. east coast from filling huge areas of the open seas with monstrously large, noisy, prohibitively expensive wind turbines. The think tank I work for, The Heartland Institute, and the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) and the American Coalition for Ocean Protection (ACOP) have hired the law firm of Gatzke, Dillon and Ballance (GDB) to represent them in evaluating the upcoming draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is producing for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Energy Project which is to be managed and constructed by Dominion Energy.

In a series of articles published by CFACT, David Wojick, Ph.D. has described in detail why the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project is almost certain to cause the extinction of the NARW.

“How to kill whales with offshore wind?” Wojick asks. “Just push them into traffic. The collision deaths would not be directly attributable to the wall of noise created by the OSW project, so who would know?”

Whales are highly sensitive to sound, which they use to navigate. The subsea infrasound and vibrations generated by the turbines are virtually guaranteed to force the few remaining NARWs out of their critical migration routes and into one of the busiest shipping corridors in the world. This will make a bad situation worse: ship collisions are already the largest single cause of NARW mortality. Even if the whales somehow prove able to adapt to and tolerate the sound, the undersea monopoles will pose new navigation hazards for them.

What does Dominion have to say about the threat to protected whales and other species? It’s impossible to tell from its official filings. As Wojick reports, Dominion has hidden the research and data about the project’s possible effect on NARWs.

“Digging into Dominion’s filing with BOEM I found … Dominion has done an actual threat assessment but it is 100% secret!” writes Wojick. “This is outrageous.” The BOEM is one of the agencies that has to review and approve the project.

Wojick notes the BOEM has a separate website devoted to the Costal Virginia Offshore Wind Project, which includes Construction and Operations Plan (COP) documents from Dominion. Even there, on an official government website, it does not state what effects the project might have on ocean life such as the endangered NARW.

The long main report contains 32 technical appendices, including “Appendix R: Threatened and Endangered Species Review.” When Wojick opened Appendix R, however, there was no discussion of the potential effects the project might have on the severely endangered NARW and other threatened and endangered species, nor of what Dominion might do to minimize any adverse impact. Instead, he found a single page stating, “Proprietary and Confidential Business Information Exempt from Public Disclosure.”

“That is all there is to Appendix R. It is 100% secret,” writes Wojick. “Even the number of pages is not disclosed, as it is with the other Appendices, that one can actually read.”

So much for the Biden administration’s supposed commitment to transparency.

“That this assessment is kept secret is outrageous all by itself, but it also raises a much deeper issue,” writes Wojick. “Will the BOEM Environmental Impact Assessment also include secret science?”

Good question. Dominion’s proposed wind project is not the first to come under heightened scrutiny from groups concerned about sea life and traditional ocean activities. Commercial fishing groups have organized to oppose a huge offshore wind project 12 nautical miles off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. They point out by the government’s own statements, the project is likely to harm sea life in the area and the shipping hazards caused by the turbines will probably result in a huge swath of traditional fishing grounds being placed off-limits to commercial fishing.

GDB currently represents plaintiffs in federal lawsuits challenging the New York Bight offshore wind project off the coast of New York and New Jersey, as well as the Vineyard Wind project off the southern shore of Martha’s Vineyard.

Industrial wind facilities’ harmful effects on wildlife are not limited to offshore projects, as thousands of birds and bats are killed each year by wind turbines. The legal protections afforded by various state and federal laws have not prevented the wholesale slaughter of these avian species. Only time, and perhaps lawsuits, will determine whether the laws protecting whales do any better for them than those protecting birds and bats have done.

When it comes to politically favored industrial wind and solar facilities, animals are no more secure in their homes than Native American tribes were in theirs when, despite treaties promising some area or another would be theirs for as long as the sun shinned and the river flowed, the government decided it wanted their land or its resources after all. The fetishistic pursuit of wind power at the expense of every other goal is the new “manifest destiny,” and it is just as deadly to living beings in its way.

“Unless BOEM requires extensive, effective, unprecedented protection measures for the North Atlantic right whale immediately, this species is almost certainly headed toward extinction,” said ACOP President David Stevenson in a press release announcing the coalition’s hiring of GDB to examine the impact of Dominion’s offshore wind project on the whales and the cost of the project to consumers. “With only a little more than 300 individual right whales alive today, this endangered species is in dire need of protection, and the Virginia Wind Project lies directly in their annual migration path. The project will require extensive daily maintenance by multiple service ships, and the potential for whale fatalities due to ship strikes is indisputable.”

CFACT President Craig Rucker says the threat to whales is not the only thing that should cause environmentalists to remove their green label of approval from this project.

“We are not only very concerned about the future of the right whale … but also concerned as to how BOEM will address the fact that this project, despite its alleged benefits regarding carbon dioxide and climate change, will actually cause the release of more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it will consume,” said Rucker in a press release.

Heartland Institute President James Taylor argues the offshore wind project should receive at least as much scrutiny as fossil fuel projects have.

“Before construction commences, the project should be given the same level of scrutiny for environmental protection by the courts and the federal authorities as has been provided for fossil fuel projects in Virginia, such as the Mountain Valley Pipeline,” said Taylor.

Dominion Energy, electric power users in Virginia, and the climate will survive if this industrial offshore wind facility fails to get approval. The same cannot be said for the North Atlantic Right Whale.

RISING CARBON DIOXIDE IS BOOSTING CROP YIELDS, NEW STUDIES CONFIRM … MODELS RUNNING HOT, SURFACE STATIONS BIASED

RISING CARBON DIOXIDE IS BOOSTING CROP YIELDS, NEW STUDIES CONFIRM

Recent research published in the European Physical Journal Plus confirms what previous studies have shown: gross primary production of all plants, including grasses, trees, flowers, and key cereal crops, increased by more than 30 percent during the twentieth century. For staple crops such as maize (corn), rice, soybean, and wheat, yields have increased by approximately 3 percent per year since 1961.

The team of scientists from a variety of universities and research institutes in Italy set out to review the recent literature on the measurable effects of climate change on a variety of types of weather event trends and the productivity of plants.

Regarding the former, their trend analysis found no discernible effect of climate change on hurricanes and tornadoes or climate disasters such as floods and droughts:

The analysis is then extended to some global response indicators of extreme meteorological events. …. None of these response indicators show a clear positive trend of extreme events. In conclusion on the basis of observational data, the climate crisis that, according to many sources, we are experiencing today, is not evident yet.

By contrast, the study finds the effect of higher carbon dioxide levels is clear and positive:

[I]t can be said that global plant biomass has changed significantly in recent decades with a phenomenon known as global greening which indicates the significant increase in productivity of ecosystems (agricultural and natural) that in recent decades was mainly highlighted by satellite monitoring. Satellite data show “greening” trends over much of the planet … are pushing back deserts around the world (both hot deserts of tropical latitudes and cold deserts of more northern latitudes) … [and] show a 31 percent increase in gross primary production during the twentieth century.

The paper, and an article in Climate-Science Press discussing it, cite multiple recent studies indicating a primary cause of the greening is the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), with as much as a 50 percent increase in photosynthesis and a more than 25 percent rise in crop yields being attributable solely to elevated CO2.

Should carbon dioxide double from preindustrial levels, the increase in gross primary productivity would rise from the present 30 percent to 50 percent, the study found.

MODELS RUNNING HOT, SURFACE STATIONS BIASED

New research published in the journal Climate Dynamics examines estimates of climate sensitivity (ECS) built into 38 of the latest-generation climate models—the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 6 (CMIP6)—and finds they vastly overstate the amount of warming, when comparing their projections with real-world measurements by ground-based monitoring systems and satellites.

The paper points out the model-estimated temperatures from a doubling of carbon dioxide range from 1.8 to 5.7 ◦C IPCC (2021), calling the large range of possible values “highly problematic as it indicates that the climate system is still poorly understood and modeled.” As a result, “the extent of future climate change is rather uncertain as the impact of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on the climate cannot yet be adequately quantified.”

In a hindcasting exercise, the researchers tested the accuracy and precision of the models in high, medium, and low emission scenarios against the mean global surface temperatures recorded from 1980 through 1990 and from 2011 through 2021 from a variety of global datasets, and to satellite measurements of temperatures for the same time periods. Their results are clear:

We found that the medium and high-ECS GCMs run too hot up to over 95% and 97% of cases, respectively. The low ECS GCM group agrees best with the warming values obtained from the surface temperature records, ranging between 0.52℃ and 0.58℃. However, when comparing the observed and GCM hindcasted warming on land and ocean regions, the surface-based temperature records appear to exhibit a significant warming bias. Furthermore, if the satellite based UAH-MSU-lt record is accurate, actual surface warming from 1980 to 2021 may have been around 0.40℃ (or less), that is up to about 30% less than what is reported by the surface-based temperature records. The latter situation implies that even the low-ECS models would have produced excessive warming from 1980 to 2021. These results suggest that the actual ECS may be relatively low, i.e. lower than 3℃ or even less than 2℃ if the 1980–2021 global surface temperature records contain spurious warming, as some alternative studies have already suggested. Therefore, the projected global climate warming over the next few decades could be moderate and probably not particularly alarming.

A recent study from The Heartland Institute confirms what this study suggests about the ground-based temperature recording system: that the data they provide is biased by poor siting.

The Education of Joseph Manchin,Greg E. Walcher,"The author of one of America’s most famous autobiographies, The Education of Henry Adams, wrote that “A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.”

West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin must be wondering where his influence stops, as his harsh education in politics continues. Manchin is often viewed as the most important swing vote in the Senate for two reasons. First, the Senate is split 50-50 between Republicans and Democrats, so passing legislation with only Democratic support requires his vote, giving him considerable influence. Second, he is all over the map politically, making his vote constantly uncertain, ironically adding further to his clout. He opposes anti-energy policies, Medicare for all, the Green New Deal, and defunding police, but supports Obamacare, federal education funding, big labor, and entitlement programs. He supported Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh but opposed Amy Coney Barrett, and voted twice to impeach President Trump. He is difficult to pigeonhole.

When Democratic congressional leaders needed his vote to pass last month’s massive climate bill, comically disguised as the “Inflation Reduction Act,” they needed Joe Manchin. He didn’t like raising corporate taxes, adding 87,000 new IRS auditors, or giant subsidies for wind and solar power. So, leadership sweetened the deal by offering Manchin something he did want – a package of energy permitting reforms he has worked on for years.

Manchin’s disappointingly modest, and far from perfect, proposal would nevertheless be the first modernization – the first reform of any kind – of the 50-year-old National Environmental Policy Acy (NEPA). That is the 1970 law requiring federal agencies to consider the impact of their decisions on the environment. It was a noble goal, but over the last five decades it has evolved into a permitting maze, almost unfathomable even to the people who get paid large sums of money to obtain permits. The regulatory hurdles, authorizations, and approvals are beyond the reach of all but large companies with substantial bank accounts and expensive lobbyists. Dozens of permits and documents are needed for most projects, and every step of the process is subject to appeals, lawsuits and delay tactics of opponents, a perversion of the envisioned public process.

Manchin’s reform package includes designating energy projects of strategic national importance and prioritizing permitting to reduce energy costs and improve reliability. It sets maximum timelines for permitting, such as two years for NEPA reviews, limits litigation delays by setting a statute of limitations for court challenges, and gives agencies 180 days to make court-ordered changes, among other badly needed reforms. They lack legal teeth but would be a good start. Today, NEPA reviews average 4.5 years, often followed by protracted litigation, and the average environmental impact statement is 600 pages long.

The need for reforming NEPA is brought home by two recent lawsuits. First, the Bureau of Land Management settled with the environmental industry by suspending its 20-year plan, pausing all oil and gas leasing on 2.2 million acres in Colorado, while the agency spends years reconsidering the impacts on climate change. There are 4,712 leases on Colorado BLM land, producing over $2.3 billion and providing millions in royalties to the state and local governments to pay for schools, police, and other public services (President Biden followed up by re-imposing a complete moratorium on leasing, for which courts have already ruled he has no legal authority). Second, a federal judge in Montana reinstated an Obama-era moratorium on coal leasing, for the same reason. This abuse of NEPA isn’t about further analysis; it’s about delaying and blocking.

Nor is the issue just about energy. Airports, highways, bridges, and other infrastructure projects – including renewable energy projects – encounter roadblocks and face costly delays because of cumbersome permitting processes. That uncertainty makes many projects uneconomical and, without updating NEPA, many will never be built.

Manchin held out his vote, until his party leaders agreed to a September vote on his energy permitting reform measure, which would then be paired with a must-pass spending bill on the House side. With that assurance, he voted for the climate bill, and Democratic leaders double-crossed him before the ink was dry. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva (D-NM) said, “I didn’t shake hands” on it, and other Democrats soon piled on. So, with little support in the House, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer this week allowed Manchin to try attaching the measure to the spending bill on the Senate floor, but Manchin was soon forced to withdraw it for lack of votes.

Manchin expected Congress to pass permitting reform. They promised, he says. But as the Wall Street Journal points out, “The West Virginia Senator’s leverage is already gone.” Grijalva gave it away by explaining, “I wasn’t part of the negotiations.” Of course not. They left him and other House leaders out, along with numerous Democratic senators, precisely so they could use that excuse to kill Manchin’s bill. The leaders never intended to honor their commitment, as Manchin has now learned. Schumer now says he only promised a vote, not support.

Unfortunately, opposition to permitting reform is costing all Americans. The abuse of NEPA is bad for the economy, driving up prices and precluding energy independence. Perhaps it’s not just Manchin, but all of us, being educated in the harsh realities of modern politics.

PRESS RELEASE: Public Interest Groups Hire Counsel to Protect Endangered Right Whale from Offshore Virginia Wind Project,"James Taylor, David T. Stevenson, Jim Lakely","ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (September 27, 2022) – A coalition of public interest groups – The Heartland Institute, the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT), and the American Coalition for Ocean Protection (ACOP) – announced today that they have hired counsel to explore a lawsuit protecting the right whale from Dominion Energy’s efforts to place an offshore wind (OSW) project directly in their habitat off the coast of Virginia.

The coalition has retained as counsel the law firm of Gatzke, Dillon and Ballance (GDB) of Carlsbad, California to represent them in evaluating the upcoming draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is producing for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Energy Project, managed and constructed by Dominion Energy of Virginia.

GDB has extensive experience representing plaintiffs pursuing litigation to defend whales and a strong track record of success in challenging proposed U.S. offshore wind projects.

“Unless BOEM requires extensive, effective, unprecedented protection measures for the North Atlantic right whale immediately, this species is almost certainly headed toward extinction,” said David Stevenson, president of ACOP. “With only a little more than 300 individual right whales alive today, this endangered species is in dire need of protection, and the Virginia Wind Project lies directly in their annual migration path. The project will require extensive daily maintenance by multiple service ships, and the potential for whale fatalities due to ship strikes is indisputable.”

Initially, GDB will provide the coalition with advice and counsel to determine if BOEM has undertaken the legally required “hard look” at the OSW Project in order to provide necessary protection for Virginia’s environment and for the state’s electricity consumers, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). In addition, the firm will advise the coalition as to whether or not the EIS draft meets the requirements of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Clean Water Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and other relevant federal and state statutes that govern the construction and maintenance of the project.

“We are very pleased to have retained the services of a law firm with such extensive expertise in the requirements of federal laws such as NEPA and ESA,” said CFACT President Craig Rucker. “We are not only very concerned about the future of the right whale, which extensively uses the ocean waters affected by the wind-power project, but also concerned as to how BOEM will address the fact that this project, despite its alleged benefits regarding carbon dioxide and climate change, will actually cause the release of more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than it will consume.”

BOEM anticipates that the draft EIS for the Virginia Wind Project will be released for public review and comment later this year. Dominion Energy is proposing to build 176 wind towers, which would stand more than 700 feet tall 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. The company has announced that it expects to begin generating electricity from the project by the end of 2026.

“The Virginia Wind Project is a risky, costly, waste of resources and a pitiful way to generate electricity for a state which claims to be business and consumer friendly,” said Heartland Institute President James Taylor. “Before construction commences, the project should be given the same level of scrutiny for environmental protection by the courts and the federal authorities as has been provided for fossil fuel projects in Virginia, such as the Mountain Valley Pipeline.”

GDB has represented plaintiffs who have brought suits against BOEM, the Department of the Interior, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and other federal agencies with respect to the New York Bight offshore wind project off the coast of New York and New Jersey, as well as the Vineyard Wind project off the southern shore of Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. These suits seek declaratory and injunctive relief and are currently pending in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia and the Federal District Court in Massachusetts, respectively.

“We are equally troubled that Virginia ratepayers could be exposed to huge rate increases resulting from intermittent, unreliable wind generation,” added Rucker. “Should litigation become necessary to remedy deficiencies in BOEM’s final EIS, we are grateful to have experienced counsel for advice as we move forward.”

The coalition intends to comment on the draft EIS within 45 days of its issuance by BOEM, unless BOEM provides for a longer public review and comment period.

Protecting What Is Already Protected,Greg E. Walcher,"The New York Times recently opined that the endangered species law could be used to stop oil and gas production nationwide, because no matter where the drilling is, it contributes to climate change everywhere. Thus, sea turtles in Florida or monk seals in Hawaii could be the excuse to shut down oil drilling Wyoming.

The Times quoted an Arizona professor questioning the government’s reliance on science, criticizing an Interior Department memo saying it cannot objectively determine whether a tiny incremental greenhouse gas emission in one spot can impact a species thousands of miles away. “It’s totally the wrong way to think about it,” the professor said, predicting that a third of all plant and animal species could be gone in 50 years (a gloomy prediction we’ve been hearing for decades). “It doesn’t matter if we don’t know that this specific well in Wyoming led to an extinction. We know what the general pattern is.”

But do we?

The almost universally accepted view, taught for generations, is that habitat is being lost to development at an alarming rate, leading to a steady decline in wildlife and biodiversity across the nation. We have discussed various solutions to the crisis for years, but it turns out the crisis may be greatly exaggerated.

My friend Rob Gordon, one of America’s most respected experts in public lands, wildlife, and endangered species, has published a new scholarly report called “Lands and Habitat in the United States: A Reality Check.” It is an eye-opener. Based on official government data, he finds that forests, grasslands, range, and other natural-state lands are “not disappearing to development at an alarming rate, and urban sprawl is not a threat at the national level.”

Yet most Americans continue to believe we must act quickly to protect and preserve what is left of the last great places. One of President Biden’s first actions was an executive order called, “Tackling the Climate Crisis…” It called for a “Government-wide approach that… conserves our lands, waters, and biodiversity.” It established the goal of “conserving at least 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030.” A Biden Interior Department press release said, “Approximately 60 percent of land in the continental U.S. is in a natural state, but we are losing a football field worth of it every 30 seconds.” In context, even if true that’s just 1.3 acres out of America’s 2.4 billion acres. At that rate, the whole country would be “lost” in only 1,756 years. The Interior press release further warns, “The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reports that only 12 percent of lands are permanently protected.” Protected from what?

The government literally owns over a third of the U.S., and through regulations has at least some control over hundreds of millions of acres of private lands, too. In other words, way more than “30 percent of our lands and waters” are already protected, unless you think the government is about to subdivide and pave national forests, parks, and BLM lands.

Land-use trends are analyzed, as Rob Gordon explains, through satellite imagery. Landsat, a joint project of NASA and USGS, is a series of satellites that photograph the earth’s surface, and continuously update the images. The “National Land Cover Database” comes from those images and supplementary data. Using that data, USGS researchers recently published an assessment of the land cover from 2001 to 2016 for the mainland U.S.

Agricultural land accounts for 22.5 percent, while all the developed land classes combined account for only 5.3 percent. The combined area of the remaining land classes – over 70 percent – is still in a variety of generally natural landscapes. Specifically, 24 percent is forested, 21 percent shrub/scrub land, 14 percent grasslands, six percent wetlands, and five percent water.

Even that doesn’t tell the story about how little of America is so developed as to destroy habitat and the environment. Of the 5.3 percent of U.S. land that is “developed,” only five percent of that is “high-intensity” development, meaning mostly paved over. Thirteen percent is medium and 28 percent low-intensity development, the remaining 54 percent classified as “open space,” even though it may lie within cities and towns. In other words, less than half of the 5.3 percent is actually “developed.” That’s perhaps 2.5 percent of the land in America, not the 40 percent Interior’s press release implies.

Most interesting is a chart comparing those numbers over the years. The USGS assessment was called “Conterminous United States Land Cover Change Patterns,” which is ironic because it shows no “change pattern.” The accompanying chart shows every single category virtually unchanged in the last two decades. The only category showing a barely perceptible change is forestland, which declined by 24,500 square miles, primarily because of wildfires, mostly in the West. It was replaced, of course, by grasslands and shrub/scrub cover, not by development. Developed land increased only a miniscule fraction, but so did both grassland and barren land.

Even with population increases, the general trend is toward more urbanization, not developing open space. Today three-fourths of Americans live in cities, over 90 percent in the eastern half of the country, and on the Pacific coast. Nine percent occupy the eight big square states, over a third of them in Denver, Phoenix, and Las Vegas. The rest of the West is almost entirely undeveloped.

We may not need new federal programs to protect our lands and waters after all. It turns out they are already protected – not by government but by nature.","September 22, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/protecting-what-is-already-protected/
Wishes and Secrets Fill Dominion’s Offshore Wind Plan,David Wojick,"I am still digging into the Construction and Operations Plan (COP) for its monster offshore wind project that Dominion Energy filed with the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. My focus is on adverse environmental impacts, especially on the severely endangered North Atlantic Right Whales that migrate through the proposed project area twice a year.

My last article pointed out that the crucial technical Appendix R on Endangered and Threatened Species was being kept secret by Dominion and BOEM. You can read that here: https://www.cfact.org/2022/09/15/dominion-hides-osw-threat-to-whales/

It turns out that this is not the only secret stuff in the COP. In addition there is a lot of hand-waving wishing when environmental impacts are addressed where you can actually read. Here is a quick look at just some of the worst of the secrets and wishes.

First some more big secrets, that is important technical appendices that are listed but not accessible by the public.

Appendix C: Marine Site Investigation Report

Appendix K: Conceptual Project Design Drawings

Appendix M: Certified Verification Agency Nomination

(I have no idea what this even means.)

Appendix W: Preliminary Cable Burial Risk Assessment (Confidential and Proprietary)

Appendix X: Metocean Assessment (Confidential and Proprietary)

(In offshore engineering, “metocean” refers to meteorology and oceanography. How can this be proprietary?)

This is a lot not to know, much of which is directly related to analyzing the potential adverse environmental impacts on endangered whales.

The wishes come in when we look at the several-hundred page main Plan, which is readable by the public. Each wish takes the form “We will do whatever it takes to avoid or mitigate this adverse environmental impact”. What it might take and whether it is even possible is not discussed.

There is no way to assess such wishful statements. But at least they tell us what some of the impact issues are, those that happen to get listed in the COP. Some threats are not mentioned, for example forcing the migrating whales into the nearby heavy traffic shipping lanes where they can be struck and killed.

The COP does discuss several major areas of concern, under the strange heading of “Biological Resources”. See The COP is at https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/Public_Sec-4-2-Biological-Resources.pdf

This discussion include whales under the heading Marine Mammals.

Interestingly they list six different whale species that are listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Three of these are said to be commonly occurring, including the severely endangered North Atlantic Right Whale. The COP estimates these Right Whales to have a total population of 412 critters but I have seen estimates as low as 320. Clearly whales are a serious issue.

They discuss various threats, especially construction noise, which I discuss in my third article. See https://www.cfact.org/2022/07/26/threat-to-endangered-whales-gets-louder/.

This discussion is followed by a very brief listing labeled “Avoidance, Minimization and Mitigation”. Here is what they say about noise reduction:

“Dominion Energy would use commercially and technically available noise-reducing technologies as appropriate and will provide marine mammal sighting and reporting training for each specific stage of construction to emphasize individual responsibility for marine mammal awareness and protection“.

That is all there is! They will do what they can and hope it helps. In my noise article I quote a federal OSW website saying that with today’s technology the noise of driving the huge monopiles holding up the towers is still “incredibly loud”. And what does “as appropriate” mean? If they feel like it?

On the operations side they specifically list the impact of “Project-related underwater noise”. But under Avoidance, Minimization and Mitigation there is nothing on this topic. Nothing! It is this endless noise that might push the migrating whales into the deadly nearby shipping lanes. There might be some discussion in Appendix R but it is all secret.

In short this so-called Plan is all description with no action when it comes to protecting the endangered whales from OSW. More broadly even a lot of project description is being kept secret.

Wishes and secrets are not a plan. When it comes to protecting the whales there is no plan.

We must save the whales from OSW.

America is Successfully Pursuing ESG = Extreme Shortages Guaranteed,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","Energy growth, electricity AND the products made from oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil and the fuels to power ships, planes, militaries, and space programs, are directly linked to prosperity and well-being across the globe.

Today, most of the energy the world consumes is from hydrocarbons, with crude oil being the dominant source of transportation fuels. Today, crude oil is the ONLY source for the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil that makes more than 6,000 products for society.

President Biden’s U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projections are that world energy consumption of crude oil, coal, natural gas, electricity from renewables, and nuclear will grow by 56 percent between 2010 and 2040. Without any replacements or clones to what fossil fuels can provide the EIA forecasts that fossil fuels will continue to supply nearly 80 percent of world energy use through 2040

President Biden and Sacramento leaders, from Governor’s Brown, Schwarzenegger, and now Newsom, have supported reductions of in-state oil production. And all remain supportive of Biden’s pledge that “we are going to get rid of fossil fuels“.

Another way to interpret Biden and Newsom’s pledge for an all-electric world:

Biden and Newsom are oblivious to the reality that everything that needs electricity is made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. In an all-electric world with JUST wind and solar electricity from breezes and sunshine, there will be nothing to power.

Biden and Newsom believe that the products and fuels manufactured from fossil fuels, are supporting lifestyles and economies, are dangerous and polluting and is causing dangerous climate change.

Biden and Newsom believe that all the infrastructures developed in less than two centuries, from the products manufactured from crude oil, are not needed by future societies, such as medical, electronics, communications, and the many transportation infrastructures such as airlines, merchant ships, automobiles, trucks, military, the space program.

Biden and Newsom believe that an all-renewable electricity system from unreliable weather conditions, WITHOUT the products and fuels from fossil fuels, can work to support a modern economy.

America is in fast pursuit toward achieving President Biden’s stated goal that “we are going to get rid of fossil fuels“. Today, Biden supports and encourages banks and investment giants to collude to reshape economies and energy infrastructure with their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels movement. ESG is an extremely dangerous precedent as the American people never voted to give banks this sort of control over our country.

With no known replacement for crude oil, Biden and the ESG believers need to be careful about eliminating “all” 3 fossil fuels! America continues to contribute to China’s domination as divesting in crude oil, the same oil that changed the world after 1900, guarantees shortages and inflation in perpetuity of products supporting societies and economies.

It seems obvious that the efforts to cease the use of crude oil may be the greatest threat to civilization. Attempting to attain a decarbonized world like the one that existed in the 1800’s and before, could result in Billions of fatalities for the eight billion on earth from disease, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths, versus the projections of millions of fatalities from changes in climate.

The world leaders are experiencing a “dangerous delusion” of a global transition to “ just electricity ” that eliminates the use of the fossil fuels that made society achieve so much in a few centuries.

There were almost 700 oil refineries as of January 2020, but as a result on continuous over regulations and permitting delays and the worldwide support of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) to divest in fossil fuels, the right operating model and level of integration will be crucial for survival and sustained profitability of refineries.

Consequently, one in five oil refineries are expected to cease operations over the next five years. One in five is 20 percent, or almost 140 refineries expected to be shuttered worldwide, resulting in a 20 percent decline in the products manufactured to meet the ever-increasing demands form society. With the reduction in manufacturing capabilities, shortages and inflation in perpetuity are likely the new norm!

As of 2021, there were eighty-eight new facilities in planning or under construction in Asia and Europe is set to see an addition of twelve petroleum refineries. The amount of oil fed through refineries in Asia has significantly increased in the past three decades as demand for petroleum products surged in developing countries such as China and India. China is on track to succeed the United States as the country with the greatest oil refinery throughput.

Today, America’s energy policies support being held hostage to unstable Petro-powers and the vagaries of foreign crude oil supplies to meet America’s demands.

The key challenge is meeting the growing demand for energy in an environmentally friendly and safe manner. Energy supplies are crucial to economic growth in both developed and developing countries to power businesses and homes, connect communities across boundaries, provide safe water, move commodities, and ultimately promote human and economic development.

While renewables continue to underperform in the generation of electricity, subsidies continue for wind and solar power plants based on “nameplate ratings”. Wind and solar should be penalized when they cannot deliver that for which they have been permitted. And while America promotes the “nameplate farce” of wind and solar, crude oil continues to be targeted for elimination along with coal and natural gas, even though oil is seldom used for generating electricity.

The unintended consequences of attempting to rid America and the world of crude oil usage are being realized in supply shortages and soaring prices resulting from the elimination of products and fuels manufactured from crude oil that support:

Asphalt for roughly sixty-five million miles of roads in the world

Tires for the 1.4 billion vehicles in the world

Fertilizers to feed the world on this increasingly resource-stretched and crowded earth.

Medical supplies that are primarily made from oil derivatives

Jets that comprise more than 50,000 for military, commercial, and private sector.

Merchant ships that comprise more than 53,000 that move products throughout the world

Vehicles that are mostly made of plastics

Renewables of wind turbines and solar panels that are made from oil derivatives

Simply put, the goal to “electrify everything” is a de facto energy tax on low- and middle-income citizens that could add more instability to already proven unstable power grids.

It is mind boggling that America continuously perpetuates greater reliance on foreign countries for the products demanded by society, and for the exotic minerals and metals to support wind, solar, and EV batteries. America is successfully pursuing ESG, i.e., Extreme Shortages Guaranteed and inflation in perpetuity that is associated with unreliable supplies to meet ever increasing demands.","September 22, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/america-is-successfully-pursuing-esg-extreme-shortages-guaranteed/
Dominion Hides OSW Threat to Whales,David Wojick,"Secrecy abounds around the monster offshore wind (OSW) project proposed by Dominion Energy. In this case it is all about the threat to the severely endangered North Atlantic Right Whales.

I earlier reported on the big hidden whale study done by the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is doing the Environment Impact Assessment for this huge project. See https://www.cfact.org/2022/07/22/are-the-feds-hiding-the-virginia-endangered-whales/.

Digging into Dominion’s filing with BOEM I found something even worse. Dominion has done an actual threat assessment but it is 100% secret! This is outrageous.

Here is a bit of background so folks can dig for themselves. There is a lot to look at.

BOEM has a separate website on this monster OSW project, which would be one of the world’s largest. The project is titled Costal Virginia Offshore Wind or CVOW. Dominion has submitted a large set of documents in what is called the Construction and Operations Plan or simply the COP.

The COP is here: https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/cvow-construction-and-operations-plan

There is a long main report plus 32 technical appendices. My endangered whales interest was immediately drawn to “Appendix R: Threatened and Endangered Species Review”. It is here: https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/CVOW-Commercial-COP-Appendix-R.pdf

I expected to get a discussion of the potential threats the project poses to the severely endangered North Atlantic Right Whale and what Dominion might do to minimize the adverse impact. I should also learn what other threatened and endangered species are involved, right?

Instead I just got a cover page bearing this notice: “Proprietary and Confidential Business Information Exempt from Public Disclosure“.

That is all there is to Appendix R. It is 100% secret. Even the number of pages is not disclosed, as it is with the other Appendices, that one can actually read.

So the huge question is”What’s the secret?” What is so secret that every word has to be kept from the public?

It cannot be the details of project construction and operation, because these are abundant in other Appendices. Nor that there are risks to others. The very next, Appendix S, is Navigation Safety Risk Assessment. There are 225 public pages there.

My guess is that it says there are real risks to the Right Whales, maybe to other species too. Of course there is nothing proprietary or business confidential about this sort of analysis. In fact it is central to public policy making.

That this assessment is kept secret is outrageous all by itself, but it also raises a much deeper issue. Will the BOEM Environmental Impact Assessment also include secret science?

BOEM is currently doing a draft EIA, scheduled to come out this December. Agencies are not allowed to disclose proprietary and confidential business information. Will BOEM ignore Appendix R, or even worse use it without disclosing it? The same is true of their secret, million dollar study of Right Whale migration. Migration behavior is central to OSW risk assessment.

Speaking of migration behavior, I got some truly valuable data from a prominent whale watching and advocacy group. They say “As for your question regarding migrations, there is a great online resource which documents surveyed and opportunistic sightings and acoustical detections of right whales called WhaleMap https://whalemap.org/WhaleMap/. In general, a subset of the population, including pregnant females, migrates to the calving area in Southeast US around November and move back to northern waters in the spring. However, there are acoustic detections in the mid-Atlantic waters year-round and not all right whales migrate. To make things more complicated, some whales have migrated to the Southeast US, returned to the northeast waters, and then back to the southeast within the same calving season.“

So it looks like Right Whale migration is complex stuff. It is like this with some birds, blue jays for example. Maybe this is what BOEM found and does not want to release. After all, their middle name us “Ocean Energy” so they are all for this monster project.

Speaking of bias I am somewhat skeptical of Dominion’s secret assessment. It was done by a heavy duty engineering group named Tetra Tech Inc. See https://www.tetratech.com/

Unfortunately their Home Page motto is “Committed to Sustainability and Climate-Positive Actions”. Offshore wind is certainly claimed to be a “Climate-Positive Action. Saving the desperately endangered North Atlantic Right Whales from these ill conceived actions, not so much. Clearly Tetra Tech is committed to this OSW project.

Since all the impact assessment to date seems to have been done secretly by proponents of the project, I expect the first draft EIA to be pretty poor when it comes to protecting the whales. Hopefully defenders of the whales will rise to the occasion.

Save the whales!","September 19, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/dominion-hides-osw-threat-to-whales/
Straight Into Darkness,Joe Bastardi,"On July 7th, I put this post on CFACT.org.

The man-made part of this is the absurd energy policies of the west to fight a phony climate war. I made that clear. We are seeing major media outlets now echoing what was said here. Remember it’s not a ripple, it is a tidal wave that is forming.

Here is a question for all you agenda-driven elites that have backed us in the corner (stop yapping about it being Putin when you laughed at Trump, you handed him the keys to this and it was just a matter of time. No one is laughing now). While you sit there and pontificate about how bad it is going to get because of your phony climate change, can IT GET ANY WORSE THAN YOU HAVE MADE IT ALREADY? The answer is yes.

Never mind the aspects listed in the blog above. The tidal wave will roar thru every other sector of European, and then US life. Just how the heck is the industry going to run in the winter? What is going to happen if the cold winter I see other people are now talking about, yet another following by others what my company has been warning people about after the heat we warned people about this year. If you have been following along you can see how these dominoes are falling–when planes can’t fly because of the lack of de-icing material, and roads can’t be cleared. The potential is that you have returned Europe to pre-industrial times! Which is likely the goal given what is going on.

And to the people in Europe waking up now though likely too late-why do you keep electing people that do this to you? Europeans are smart people, yet the history of the continent continues to be searching for a way to self-destruct for some reason. Look at your history.

Is there hope? There is always hope. Perhaps people will awake to what Reagan, then Trump said about relying on Russian energy. Perhaps they will realize that ESG has other countries like China laughing at the west as they build a coal plant a day, while the western leaders send their populations into the abyss.

This may not be the misery of what other despots before have done to Europe. But it shares in common massive misery caused by people that Europeans as a whole have allowed being put in power–that America has completely forfeited its role, and then turns around and blames Trump, Covid, Putin, climate, the man on the moon, you name it–for the misery that is self-inflicted and is plainly originating with this phony climate war, speaks volumes about the decay of the west.

The ultimate irony, If you read the writings of the west’s biggest adversaries, they note with disdain that decay. Solzhenitsyn spoke about it 4 decades ago once he got out of the Gulag, warning us. But even people that hate us, note it.

Well, this is a different kind of Gulag. And the west has no one to blame but themselves. You fight phony issues and the populace accepts, then you get the leaders you deserve. There is no excuse for this. There is no rational way to explain it except the acceptance of a phony issue and abdication of individual will and spirit among enough people to subject themselves to this.

In the 1930s, no one would do anything or resist when thousands, then millions of innocent people were enslaved and then butchered for some so-called higher ideal (heck we had sympathizers in the highest echelons of power here in the US and in Europe). There are no trains carrying people away here (Myy my, what progress we have made in being more civil in our enslavement of people). Heck, they probably would not be able to run in the winter anyway this year. This is of different nature while physical deaths will not be as great ( though certainly, people being cold is likely to enhance the death rate–maybe Dr. Fauci can get us a vaccine for that), the destruction of the human spirit and the enslavement to a system of countless people wishing for a better life and seeing that chance being killed has evolved. This used a phony climate war for some mythical higher calling. With the Nazis, it was the thousand-year Reich, the Soviet Union–Worldwide communism. And it is going beyond tragedy. It’s taking Europe and the west straight into hell. And these people are greasing the rails for it.

Am I being too extreme? Well, let’s see what happens this coming winter. The July 7th blog nailed what is going on now, and people are picking up on it. But it’s worse than that. It’s a forecast I hope I am wrong on.

Sterling Burnett,"In sharp contrast to the climate change reporting from most corporate media outlets, rates of crime, disease, famine, natural disaster damages, war, and the quality of life on Earth for most people in most places have dramatically improved over the past century.

Lifespans have improved, infant mortality has declined, fewer people are malnourished or die from hunger, more people are literate, and natural disasters and nonoptimal temperatures claim fewer lives than ever before.

Bjorn Lomborg, Ph.D., president of the Copenhagen Consensus and a visiting fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, discusses all of this in a recent New York Post column, writing,

We are incessantly told about disasters, whether it is the latest heatwave, flood, wildfire or storm. Yet the data overwhelmingly shows that over the past century, people have become much, much safer from all these weather events. Indeed, in the 1920s, around half a million people were killed by weather disasters, whereas in the last decade the death-toll averaged around 18,000. This year, just like 2020 and 2021, is tracking below that. Why? Because when people get richer, they get more resilient.

As reported previously in Climate Realism, deaths from disastrous or extreme weather events are 98 percent lower now than they were in the 1920s, 100 years of global warming ago. In addition, multiple peer-reviewed studies show deaths from nonoptimal temperatures have declined by thousands each year over the past three decades. Why? Because cold temperatures cause more adverse health events and result in 17 times more premature deaths than hot temperatures. As the Earth has modestly warmed, the number of people succumbing to heat-related deaths has barely increased, while the number of people dying from nonoptimal cold temperatures has fallen dramatically.

Lomborg goes on to observe that, contrary to corporate media coverage of climate change, the amount of land lost to wildfires since 1900 has declined by almost half, from 4.5 percent of the land area of the world would burning every year in 1900 to just 2.5 percent burning annually in 2021.

In addition, Lomborg notes, as Climate Realism has also covered extensively, data show the Great Barrier Reef has reached its greatest extent since data began being recorded consistently in 1985, and polar bear numbers are currently at record highs. A person following the daily coverage of the so-called “climate crisis” in mainstream media wouldn’t know these facts.

Lomborg continues, discussing demographic trends that demonstrate human life is improving as the Earth warms:

There are so many bad-news stories that we seldom stop to consider that on the most important indicators, life is getting much better. Human life expectancy has doubled over the past century, from 36 years in 1920 to more than 72 years today. A hundred years ago, three-quarters of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. Today, it’s less than one-tenth.

The deadliest environmental problem, air pollution, was four-times more likely to kill you in 1920 than today, mostly through people in poverty cooking and heating with dung and wood.

Although Lomborg doesn’t discuss this, the Earth as a whole is greening and crop yields have regularly set records year after year, due in no small part to the positive fertilization affect rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have had on plant life. Fruit, grain, and staple crop production have all increased during the current warming, in developing and developed countries alike.

As agronomy and botany explain, the addition of approximately 135 parts per million of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by humans has helped dramatically reduce hunger by increasing the photosynthetic productivity and improving the water use of plants. As a result, the number of hungry people has declined by two billion since 1990. Research shows there is now 17 percent more food available per person than there was 30 years ago.

One should keep these facts in mind the next time a media Chicken Little reports catastrophic climate change is coming as a result of a few days of extreme weather, a short-term drought, or a seasonal wildfire, hurricane, or tornado. Don’t head for a bunker or quit eating meat, driving, or flying—at least, not to prevent a supposed climate catastrophe. Long-term trends for all these types of weather-related events provide no evidence they are worsening, and some are even declining. Human health and nutrition are also getting better, despite what climate scolds keep trying to tell you.

Follow the evidence. It should alleviate any fears that a climate apocalypse is in the offing. In the immortal words of Bobby McFerrin, “Don’t Worry, Be Happy!”

Landscape Footprint Limits Attractiveness of Renewable Power Sources

A recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One suggests the comparative land “footprints” of various renewable electric power sources could limit their attractiveness and prevent the amount of development needed to obtain net-zero emissions from generating sources.

The researchers write,

The global energy system has a relatively small land footprint at present, comprising just 0.4% of ice-free land. This pales in comparison to agricultural land use—30–38% of ice-free land—yet future low-carbon energy systems that shift to more extensive technologies could dramatically alter landscapes around the globe. The challenge is more acute given the projected doubling of global energy consumption by 2050 and widespread electrification of transportation and industry. … We find a range of LUIE that span four orders of magnitude, from nuclear with 7.1 ha/TWh/y to dedicated biomass at 58,000 ha/TWh/y. By applying these LUIE results to the future electricity portfolios of ten energy scenarios, we conclude that land use could become a significant constraint on deep decarbonization of the power system, yet low-carbon, land-efficient options are available.

The researchers surveyed the existing literature and calculated the land-use intensity, measured as hectares occupied per terawatt-hour of electricity generated in a given year, or ha/TWh/y (LUIE), “for real-world electricity generation—not hypothetical or modeled electricity generation—across all major sources of electricity and a broad geographic distribution.” The geographic distribution used multiple data sets covering 73 countries and 45 states in the United States. They examined the landscape coverage of “coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), geothermal, hydroelectric, and biomass (including electricity from dedicated biomass feedstock production, hereafter called “dedicated biomass,” and electricity from waste and residue biomass, hereafter called “residue biomass.”)

The LUIE rating calculates the amount of land taken up or dedicated to the actual generating source or power plant. For dispersed sources, the rating accounts for the spacing necessary across the various types of landscapes, the size of reservoirs created by hydroelectric dams, and indirect land use related to mining or producing coal and natural gas, plus transportation of the fuel or materials.

Instead of focusing strictly on emissions from power sources, governments should also consider the land footprint, because their populations certainly do. In general, the greater the land footprint, absent mitigation or restoration where possible, the greater the disruption of ecosystems and the displacement of alternative uses of the land.

As you might imagine, indirect land use problems dominate biomass, coal, hydroelectric, and natural gas power sources, whereas spacing issues are the dominant land use problems for solar and wind.

For the smallest land footprint per amount of energy produced, nuclear is the clear winner, with geothermal having the second smallest footprint. Concentrated solar, solar photovoltaics, wind, and dedicated biomass have the largest land use footprints per unit of power produced.

Commenting on the importance of understanding the LUIE when considering future electric power schemes with regard to all the possible impacts and relative benefits and costs of different electric power sources, climate scientist Judith Curry writes,

The land footprint of energy systems displaces natural ecosystems, leads to land degradation, and creates trade-offs for food production, urban development, and conservation. In densely populated countries such as Japan, Bangladesh, Lebanon, South Korea, India, Netherlands, Belgium, Bahrain and Israel, there simply isn’t sufficient land to support a majority of the energy supply coming from renewables.

Even in the United States, with our relative abundance of land, communities are increasingly rejecting industrial wind and solar, due partly to their large footprints.

When reviewing this study, one point that was unclear to me was whether, in their real-world analysis, the researchers took into account the intermittent delivery of power from wind and solar and counted the power produced from coal, natural gas, and nuclear to supplement, regulate, and/or replace intermittent sources throughout the year, in calculating the footprints of wind and solar and those for the traditional sources. In addition, it was not clear how much of the footprint from mining for rare earths and other critical minerals necessary for renewables was counted against them, given that the critical minerals have multiple demands and uses. Finally, for none of the possible energy sources did I see a calculation of the space required for disposal of the waste material generated during development and mining or the actual generating sources themselves when their respective productive lives end.

U.K. Reversing Course on Climate, Fracking

New U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss’ early actions on energy and climate represent a significant departure not just from the previous administration of Boris Johnson but from those of the last few British PMs. Truss’ predecessors committed the nation to draconian carbon dioxide reductions at the expense of affordable, reliable, energy for U.K. residents.

Truss, by contrast, has appointed lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg as Secretary of the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy and former trade secretaries Ranil Jayawardena as Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs and Anne-Marie Trevelyan as Secretary of State for Transport. These ministers will be charged with advancing the U.K.’s energy security and developing the nation’s critical infrastructure and climate policies.

Environmentalists expressed dismay at these appointments because the new ministers have all expressed skepticism about climate change portending a global catastrophe and/or that restricting the use of fossil fuels and replacing them with wind and solar will be good for the country. Rees-Mogg, Jayawardena, and Trevelyan all seem to reject, in the words of the BBC, “the idea that environmental problems can be addressed by limiting our consumption of resources.”

Reuters notes Rees-Mogg previously expressed concerns about “climate alarmism,” saying “humanity should adapt to, rather than mitigate, ‘climate change,’ and warned that the drive to getting to net zero emissions is responsible for high energy prices.” In keeping with that concern, Rees-Mogg said his first order of business would be to reduce energy prices for the public. As part of that, Rees-Mogg reiterated his support for expediting licenses for new North Sea oil and gas development, having vowed in the past to extract “every last drop” of it.

Jayawardena has consistently opposed installing huge solar industrial facilities in the countryside, stating in 2021, “If you feel strongly about protecting our countryside from solar farms, write to your local councilor and give them the support they need to take action quickly to protect our countryside from them.”

As a member of Parliament, Trevelyan led campaigns to expand or widen major highways and sent out tweets skeptical of alarming climate claims. Trevelyan tweeted, for example, that the country didn’t need more wind farms because “we aren’t getting hotter, global warming isn’t actually happening,” reports Forbes.

In addition to appointing a slate of climate realists as cabinet secretaries, Truss has already issued an order lifting the absolute ban on fracking that had been in place across the UK since 2019. Truss indicated the order was intended to bolster Britain’s domestic energy supplies to provide relief for residents and businesses for whom energy bills have risen dramatically in recent years. Subject to local approval, Truss said some areas “could get gas flowing in as soon as six months,” the Financial Times reports.

Truss’ plan would have local utilities provide power at discounted rates, to garner communities’ support for fracking in their areas.

“In return for absolute policy support, the U.K. shale gas industry will deliver community benefits to ease bills for local residents, as well as energy security, jobs, tax [revenue], and a lower carbon gas supply,” said Charles McAllister, director of Policy, Government, and Public Affairs at UK Onshore Oil and Gas, in response to Truss’ decision.

"Washington, DC’s Energy Colonialism",Paul Driessen,"Washington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser thinks people worldwide have a “human right” to come to the United States, legally or illegally. Our nation’s capital proudly proclaimed itself a “sanctuary city” in 2016. “We celebrate our diversity and respect all DC residents,” the mayor said, “no matter their immigration status.”

But when Arizona and Texas were overwhelmed by a million-plus illegal migrants – and their governors sent a couple thousand of them to Washington – she was outraged.

They have “overwhelmed” our public services, she complained. The sanctuary city faces “an emergency,” a “humanitarian crisis.” DC taxpayers “should not be picking up the tab” for housing and feeding these once-celebrated immigrants. We need National Guard troops to help cope, she pleaded – twice.

Her city of 707,000 people, 10,000 city government employees and a proposed FY2023budget of $19.5 billion cannot cope with a few thousand migrants? But little border towns should happily accommodate the tsunami of illegals Mr. Biden has allowed to cross our southern border?

Chickens coming home to roost can be painful. But the real problem is the (willful) inability of progressive politicians and activists to foresee even easily foreseeable consequences of their decisions – and then demand that scapegoats pay to fix the problems the progressives caused.

The District of Columbia is about to inflict an enormous new set of roosting-chicken realities on its residents – and even more on its neighbors: Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.

Led by Councilwoman Mary Cheh, DC’s City Council recently passed two laws banning fossil fuels for heating, cooking, and city-owned vehicles. Together, they position their city as a top virtue signaler on manmade climate change, which Ms. Cheh calls “the single most important environmental issue of our time.” Mayor Bowser enthusiastically endorsed the efforts.

The “Clean Energy DC Building Code Amendment Act” prohibits fossil fuels for home and water heating in new commercial buildings (including residential buildings four stories and higher), starting in 2027. It also requires that restaurants and families cook with electricity instead of natural gas. Only buildings deemed “essential to protecting public health and safety” may use gas for backup electricity generation.

The “Climate Commitment Act” forbids fossil fuel heat for new district-owned buildings, including schools, by 2025. It requires that all DC vehicles be “zero-emission” by 2026; all District operations be “carbon-free” by 2040; and the entire city be “carbon-neutral” by 2045.

Every successive fossil fuel reduction will require expanded electricity use – and generation. With DC-based nuclear almost certainly a nonstarter, power generation will presumably be via “renewable energy,” mostly wind and solar. But these technologies are intermittent, unreliable and weather-dependent. They must be backed up by batteries that must be recharged constantly, by more wind and solar power.

Let me say it yet again. Wind and sunshine are renewable and sustainable. However, the materials needed to harness this energy to power modern civilization absolutely are not. This DC Green New Deal alone would require millions of tons of metals, minerals, concrete and plastics; billions of tons of ores, and hundreds of new mines and factories – in the United States, China, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere.

With China, India and other countries burning more fossil fuels to improve people’s living standards – and supply all those “green energy” needs – global greenhouse gas emissions will continue rising. Even assuming fossil fuel emissions actually do drive climate change, DC’s “historic” laws might therefore reduce average global temperatures by 0.0002 degrees by 2100.

Washington already imports 100% of its electricity from neighboring states. So can virtue-signaling DC government officials answer just a few of many fundamental questions?

Exactly how many wind turbines, solar panels and backup-power battery modules will DC need by 2025, 2026, 2040 and 2045, as your electricity requirements skyrocket? (Please factor in the size and type of “renewable” energy equipment you plan to install each year – and how many hours per day, week and year the sun will shine and wind will blow in the decades after the systems are installed.)

Exactly how many tons of lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, copper, iron, magnesium, aluminum, concrete, petroleum, fiberglass, and other metals, minerals and materials will be needed to manufacture all these turbines, panels, batteries, transmission lines, transformers, and electric vehicles and appliances?

Exactly how much coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear power will be required to operate all those mostly overseas mines, processing facilities and factories? How much carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, and toxic air and water pollutants will they emit?

Will DC require “responsible sourcing” for the massive amounts of metals and minerals needed to honor its “climate commitment” – regardless of how this will increase your costs? Will you demand more mines and quarries in the United States – and opening more US onshore and offshore areas to mineral exploration – so that America is not more dependent on China, child and slave labor, and environmental desecration in foreign lands, for your “green energy” raw materials?

Where exactly do you intend to locate the hundreds of wind turbines and millions of solar panels this “transition” will require? On DC city rooftops? In Rock Creek Park and the Potomac River?

Or do you plan to install them in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean – and connect them to DC with hundreds of miles of new high-voltage transmission lines through your neighbors’ back yards? Don’t their scenic areas, habitats and wildlife have value?

Where do you plan to warehouse your electric vehicles and a half-million half-ton battery modules for just one week of backup power? Those batteries pose significant fire hazards, and therefore must be located far from residences, offices, garages and parking lots. Electric cars and buses must be parked far from buildings and one another, to avoid chemical-fueled infernos.

Will the federal government also have to get by on this zero-carbon energy? What happens when electricity generation doesn’t meet DC needs, and inevitable blackouts hit? Whose electricity gets cut off first? Ms. Cheh, Mayor Bowser, Greenies, President Biden, Democrats and Deep State bureaucrats?

We assume you think DC taxpayers should not be expected to “pick up the tab” for trying to “save the planet” from “climate cataclysms.” But why should your neighbors be forced to pick up the tab for your meaningless zero-emission virtue-signaling? Why should the rest of the world do so?

What “say” will residents of these states have in these decisions – especially those who’ll be expected to live next to vast wind and solar “farms,” and suffer the infrasound, light flicker and other tranquility-disrupting and health-impairing effects of your “clean, renewable” energy facilities in their backyards?

How will you respond when Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland vote or sue to reject DC’s energy imperialist facilities – or when some really upset citizens engage in “mostly peaceful” protests in downtown DC, the way Antifa types rejected fracking, pipelines, mining, inequality and police brutality?

One has to wonder whether DC’s real objective is sustainability, sustained moralizing – or energy colonialism and totalitarian control over people’s lives, livelihoods and living standards. Why doesn’t DC just buy carbon credits and pretend it’s becoming a virtuous shade of green, the way Al Gore does?

In any event, not many DC neighbors are excited about becoming energy colonies for our nation’s capital, as it asserts itself as an arbiter of climate, energy, environmental, social and government ethics.

For that matter, we’re definitely not thrilled about Democrat and Biden Administration actions on these issues. Maybe they can start answering these same questions – on statewide and national scales, where the amounts of “clean, green, renewable” energy installations, raw materials, mining, manufacturing, pollution, and slave and child labor are truly monumental and mind-boggling.","September 14, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/washington-dcs-energy-colonialism/
Is Net Zero Emissions the Trojan Horse for Society?,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The transition to electricity generation from breezes and sunshine has proven to be ultra-expensive for the wealthy countries of Germany, Australia, and the USA representing 6 percent of the world’s population (505 million vs 7.8 billion). Those wealthy countries now have among the highest cost for their electricity, while the poorer developing countries, currently without the usage of the 20th century products manufactured from crude oil, are experiencing about 11,000,000 child deaths every year due to the unavailability of the fossil fuel products used in wealthy countries.

High electricity costs trickle down to everything in our daily lives, from the cost of food, lumber, and services, and ultimately to the high cost of living and housing and perpetuates the rise in homelessness and poverty.

The intermittency of weather generated electricity has resulted in the “nameplate” generating capacity of wind turbines and solar panels being a farce capacity to replace continuous uninterruptible electricity generation from coal, natural gas, and nuclear.

Those with a passion to rid the world of crude oil are oblivious to the fact that crude oil is virtually useless, it’s manufactured (refineries) into something usable. Those oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil are the basis of more than 6,000 products in our daily lives that did not exist before the 1900’s, and the fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of aircraft for military, commercial, private and the President’s Air Force One, and merchant ships, and the military and space programs.

Those so-called renewables of wind turbines and solar panels cannot manufacture fuels for the:

50,000 heavy-weight and long-range merchant ships that are moving products throughout the world.

50,000 heavy-weight and long-range jets used by commercial airlines, private usage, and the military.

The 290 million registered vehicles in the U.S. as of 2021, that were comprised of about 56 percent trucks, 40 percent cars, and 4 percent motorcycles.

The cruise ships that now move twenty-five million passengers around the world.

The space program.

Advocates of a carbon-free world underestimate not only how many products and fuels manufactured from crude oil the world already uses, but how much more the world will yet demand. In America, there are nearly as many vehicles as people, while in most of the world, fewer than 1 in 20 people have a car. More than 80 percent of the world population has yet to take a single flight.

The few wealthy countries have short memories of petrochemical products and human ingenuity being the reasons for the world populating from 1 to 8 billion in less than two hundred years. Efforts to cease the use of crude oil will be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change, and lead the world to an era of guaranteed extreme shortages of fossil fuel products like we had in the decarbonized world in the 1800’s. It can only lead back to shorter life spans, diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths resulting from the elimination of fossil fuels that are benefiting society.

The reasons why subsidized wind and solar electricity are not replacing fossil fuels, is that they can only generate electricity intermittently. Wind turbines and solar panels cannot manufacture anything for society. In fact, all the parts for wind and solar are made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. Ridding the world of crude oil would eliminate wind turbines and solar panels!

The world leaders are experiencing a “dangerous delusion” of a global transition to “just electricity” that eliminates the use of the fossil fuels that made society achieve so much in a few centuries.

There were almost 700 oil refineries as of January 2020, but as a result on continuous over regulations and permitting delays and the worldwide support of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) to divest in fossil fuels, the right operating model and level of integration will be crucial for survival and sustained profitability of refineries.

Consequently, one in five oil refineries are expected to cease operations over the next five years. One in five is 20 percent, or almost 140 refineries expected to be shuttered worldwide, resulting in a 20 percent decline in the products manufactured to meet the ever-increasing demands form society. With the reduction in manufacturing capabilities, shortages and inflation in perpetuity are likely the new norm!

And MOST importantly today, there is a lost reality that the primary usage of crude oil is NOT for the generation of electricity, but to manufacture derivatives and fuels which are the ingredients of everything needed by economies and lifestyles to exist and prosper. Energy realism requires that the legislators, policymakers, and media that demonstrate pervasive ignorance about crude oil usage understand the staggering scale of the decarbonization movement.

Yes, the climate is changing, as it has been for four billion years, and will continue to change, and yes, there will be fatalities from the coming climate changes. Climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, between 2030 and 2050, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.

However, the irresponsible idea that global warming poses an immediate existential risk for the world, that risk will be small in comparison to a world without fossil fuels, while current governments and corporate leaderships are attempting to revert to its decarbonized status in the early 1800’s and before.

The wealthy countries continue to focus on subsidizing intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine while simultaneously shuttering coal, natural gas, and nuclear power plants that have been providing continuous uninterruptible electricity. The Trojan Horse results are extreme costs, painful reductions in living standards for all but the richest, national weakness, and societal instability.

"No, Melting Greenland Ice Is Not About to Swamp Coastal Areas",H. Sterling Burnett,"A study published in Nature Climate Change in late August claimed anthropogenic climate change has already committed approximately 3.3 percent of the Greenland ice sheet to melting—approximately 110 trillion tons of ice. By itself, that would cause nearly a foot of global sea-level rise, the article stated. Even worse, the researchers estimate if the high-period ice loss experienced across 2011 through 2012 were to resume and continue throughout the end of the century, the ice melt could be 185 percent greater, with a correspondingly bigger sea level rise.

Corporate media outlets were quick to hype the extreme outlier projections of this single study. CBS News, CNBC, CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, to name just a few, gave the report prominent, alarmingly headlined coverage.

As with so many frightening climate claims, in the words of Carl Sagan (which were a restatement of Pierre-Simon Laplace), “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”

The study and the news stories hyping it definitely lack extraordinary evidence. Hard data backing up the claim of alarming amounts of Greenland ice melt driving increasing rates of sea level rise is absent, probably because such data does not exist.

As my colleague meteorologist Anthony Watts pointed out in a Climate Realism article addressing The Washington Post‘s story about the Nature Climate Change study, all the scenarios in the report were based on computer model projections, and such projections have been consistently wrong in the past. This is not surprising: the models themselves have fatal flaws that make their projections untrustworthy:

One of the favorite scare stories that has continued to circulate about effects of climate change is the never-ending alarm over future sea level rise. Back in 1989, when today’s catch-all phrase of “climate change” was known as “global warming,” there was this prediction from the United Nations (UN) covered in an Associated Press story[:] “A senior U.N. environmental official says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000.” That claim voiced by the UN official was based on computer models projecting future sea levels. Obviously, the models were wrong, because [what was described in] that claim never happened. Today, 22 years past the due date, not one country, not even a city, has been “wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels.”

The projections were wrong then, and the data indicates they are almost certainly wrong now. As Watts points out, although 110 trillion tons of ice loss sounds enormous, it is a minuscule portion of the total amount of ice in Greenland’s ice sheets. In addition, weather patterns, not climate change, dominate Greenland’s ice volume and its variations over time.

As Watts notes, in a July 2021 Guardian story the paper asserted “Greenland: Enough Ice Melted on Single Day to Cover Florida in Two Inches of Water.” That amount of melting would have amounted to more glacial melting in Greenland in a single day than NASA measured in the previous three decades, which indicates the Guardian‘s claim was probably grossly false. Even if true, the Guardian failed to report on the next day’s weather in Greenland, during which all that melted water refroze when the clouds returned. The water never made it to the ocean, and thus it had no effect on sea levels.

The new study cited by The Washington Post and other corporate media climate alarm flacks failed to include the influence of weather patterns, assuming instead a simple linear causation from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warming the planet to Greenland glacial melting. There is no such direct causal connection.

The same week as the model-driven study was published, data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) and Denmark’s Polar Portal undermined the claims of accelerating ice loss and provided factual support for Watts’ analysis.

On August 29, Greenland posted a gain of seven billion tons of ice. This represented the largest single-day ice gain the DMI has recorded since it began keeping consistent records in 1981, more than 40 years ago. This gain was remarkable not only for the amount of ice but because it came in the waning days of the Arctic summer, when ice is usually still melting. Other data from the DMI throws further shade on Nature Climate Change for publishing the ill-considered (and as it turns out, ill-timed) study, and the media outlets that publicized the report as terrifying breaking news. It turns out, according to the DMI, Greenland’s surface ice mass balance for the 2021-2022 ice year, even before fall and winter 2022 arrive, is well above the mean average for 1981 through 2010, the 30 year period DMI uses for comparison. And that was before Greenland gained an additional seven billion tons of ice on August 29.

To be fair, one day’s ice gain or loss (take note, Guardian!) doesn’t mean Greenland won’t suffer a net loss of ice over the next century. It may, or it may not. What it does show is that there is no direct connection between human greenhouse gas emissions and Greenland’s ice mass. Also, if Greenland is losing ice on net and contributing to accelerating sea level rise, something must be offsetting it: neither tide gauge records (see also Hedke) nor satellite data indicate the rate of sea level rise over the past 200 years has been accelerating consistently around the globe.

There are plenty of problems to solve and things to worry about in the world today without adding phantom fears of rising seas swamping the coasts because of ice loss in Greenland, based on flawed computer model projections.

ARCTIC GLACIER EXTENT GREATER NOW THAN IN THE PAST … TEXAS FIGHTS WOKE INVESTING

ARCTIC GLACIER EXTENT GREATER NOW THAN IN THE PAST

A recent study published in the journal Climate of the Past shows there are more Arctic glaciers and ice caps at present, and they extend farther and are thicker, than at several times since the end of the last ice age, contrary to what is commonly claimed.

The research indicates the Arctic was warmer than at present between 8,000 and 4,000 years ago, with 80 percent to 100 percent of glaciers and ice caps (GICs) being smaller than today or absent entirely. If the research is correct, the Arctic’s modern ice extent is among the largest of the last 10,000 years, higher than even during the Roman and Medieval Warm Periods.

As No Tricks Zone reports, the paper from Laura J. Larocca and Yarrow Axford, scientists with the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Northwestern University, indicates “any recession of GICs in the last few centuries is but a partial return to a former period of much greater warmth.”

The scientists’ conclusions are based on a comprehensive survey they conducted of the Arctic glaciers and ice caps near lakes and coasts in Alaska, Arctic Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Svalbard, and the Russian Arctic. Larocca and Axford write,

For each region and for the full Arctic, we summarize evidence for when GICs were smaller than today or absent altogether, indicating warmer-than-present summers, and evidence for when GICs regrew in lake catchments, indicating summer cooling. … [T]he full Arctic compilation suggests that the majority (50 % or more) of studied GICs were smaller than present or absent by ∼10 ka. We find the highest percentage (>90 %) of Arctic GICs smaller than present or absent in the middle Holocene at ∼ 7–6 ka, probably reflecting more spatially ubiquitous and consistent summer warmth during this period than in the early Holocene. … Our review finds that in the first half of the Holocene, most of the Arctic’s small GICs became significantly reduced or melted away completely in response to summer temperatures that, on average, were only moderately warmer than today.

TEXAS FIGHTS WOKE INVESTING

In late August, the Texas Comptroller released a list of financial institutions in which state agencies are prohibited from investing, under a state law barring Texas government entities from stock fund management by, bank account holdings in, or brokering of bond sales with firms that boycott or call for divesting from companies involved in the oil and gas industry.

The Chairman of the Railroad Commission of Texas supported the move, warning, “If you boycott Texas oil and gas, we boycott you,” according to OilPrice.

A Texas law passed in 2021 prohibiting any state agency or political subdivision of the state, such as counties and municipalities, from entering into “a qualifying contract with a value of $100,000 or more for goods and services unless the contract contains a written verification from the contracted company that it does not and will not during the contract term boycott energy companies.”

The law also directs the Texas Comptroller to “prepare and maintain, and provide to each state governmental entity, a list of all companies that boycott energy companies.” The government entities are required to warn the companies on the comptroller’s list they are on it and they have 90 days to alter their anti-fossil fuel investment strategies. If a company or fund fails to remove its policies banning investment in companies in the fossil fuel industry, the government entity “shall sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities of the company,” the law states.

Since the law has passed, several municipal bond sales initially planned for offering by banks boycotting oil and gas companies were withdrawn and offered by alternative, legally compliant financial institutions.

The firms on Texas’ blacklist of banned companies include a roster of giants in the fields of banking, investment banking, and portfolio management: some ESG funds managed by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, BlackRock (the world’s biggest asset manager), BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, Danske Bank, Jupiter Fund Management, Nordea Bank, Schroders PLC, Svenska Handelsbanken, Swedbank, and UBS Group. The list of banned funds names more than 350 firms.

“My greatest concern is the false narrative that has been created by the environmental crusaders in Washington, D.C., and Wall Street that our economy can completely transition away from fossil fuels, when, in fact, they will be part of our everyday life into the foreseeable future,” Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar said in a statement announcing the list. “A complete divestment of the industry is not only impractical and illogical but runs counter to the economic well-being of Texas and our citizens.”

OilPrice reports,

The oil and gas regulator in the state, the Railroad Commission of Texas, welcomed the Comptroller’s move, [saying in a statement] that “Texas is leading the fight to curb the expansion of the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) movement, a woke investment strategy that places a priority on subjective environmental and social metrics instead of financial metrics that ensure quality returns for investors.”

“Texas is far from the only state dealing with this issue, with the Attorney Generals [AG] of 19 states signing a letter with similar sentiment last year,” OilPrice reports, noting the states’ actions are a growing response to and rejection of the “growing trend of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment which many financial firms have embraced.”

The 19 state AGs sent a letter to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in early August, saying they were concerned about his publicly stated commitment to reaching net-zero emissions across all his firm’s assets.

“Rather than being a spectator betting on the game, BlackRock appears to have put on a quarterback jersey and actively taken the field,” the attorney generals stated.

West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore said the Board of Treasury Investments, which manages the state’s roughly $8 billion of operating funds, announced in January 2022 the state would no longer do business with five financial institutions which he determined were working to undermine West Virginia’s economic well-being by pushing ESG and net-zero business investment: BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

“Any company that thinks Communist China is a better investment than West Virginia energy or American capitalism clearly has a bad strategy,” Moore said at the time.

Electric Cars Are Not “Zero-Emission Vehicles”,James Agresti,"While praising California’s decision to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035, Governor Gavin Newsom declared that this will require “100% of new car sales in California to be zero-emission vehicles” like “electric cars.” In reality, electric cars emit substantial amounts of pollutants and may be more harmful to the environment than conventional cars.

Toxic Pollution

The notion that electric vehicles are “zero-emission” is rooted in a deceptive narrative that ignores all pollutants which don’t come out of a tailpipe. Assessing the environmental impacts of energy technologies requires measuring all forms of pollution they emit over their entire lives, not a narrow slice of them. To do this, researchers perform “life cycle assessments” or LCAs. As explained by the Environmental Protection Agency, LCAs allow for:

the estimation of the cumulative environmental impacts resulting from all stages in the product life cycle, often including impacts not considered in more traditional analyses (e.g., raw material extraction, material transportation, ultimate product disposal, etc.). By including the impacts throughout the product life cycle, LCA provides a comprehensive view of the environmental aspects of the product or process and a more accurate picture of the true environmental trade-offs in product and process selection.

LCAs are subject to multiple levels of uncertainty, but an assessment published by the Journal of Cleaner Production in 2021 shatters the notion that electric cars are cleaner than conventional ones, much less “zero emission.” The LCA found that manufacturing, charging, operating, and disposing of electric vehicles produces more of every major category of pollutants than conventional cars. This includes:



an increase in fine particulate matter formation (26%), human carcinogenic (20%) and non-carcinogenic toxicity (61%), terrestrial ecotoxicity (31%), freshwater ecotoxicity (39%), and marine ecotoxicity (41%) relative to petrol vehicles.

Foreshadowing that result, a 2018 report by the European Environment Agency warned that studies on the “human toxicity impacts” of electric vehicles were “limited” and that electric cars “could be responsible for greater negative impacts” than conventional cars.

Similarly, a 2018 article in the journal Environmental Research Letters stated that a failure to account for the “environmental implications” of mining lithium to make batteries for electric cars “would directly counter the intent” of “incentivizing electric vehicle adoption” and “needs to be urgently addressed.”

The 2021 paper in the Journal of Cleaner Production has now addressed this issue, and it shows electric cars emit more toxic pollution than gasoline-powered cars. Yet, politicians who embraced the electric car agenda before comprehensive data was available continue to plow ahead in spite of the facts.

Local Pollution

Regardless of overall toxic emissions, the European Environment Agency points out that electric vehicles “potentially offer local air quality benefits” because pollution from their manufacturing, charging, and disposal is usually emitted away from densely populated areas.

Simply stated, switching to electric cars transfers pollution from urbanites in wealthy nations to poor countries that mine and manufacture their components and to communities with power plants and disposal sites. In the words of the 2021 paper in the Journal of Cleaner Production, this “transfer of environmental burdens” causes “workers and ecosystems in third countries” to be “exposed to higher rates of toxic substances.”

China dominates the global supply chains for green energy components not merely because of cheap labor but because they have lax environmental standards that tolerate the pollution these products create. Thus, China supplies 78% of the world’s solar cells, 80% of the world’s lithium-ion battery chemicals, and 73% of the world’s finished battery cells.

Highlighting the implications of “China’s role in supplying critical minerals for the global energy transition,” a 2022 study by the Brookings Institute found that “continued reliance on China” will “increase the risk that sourcing of critical minerals will cause or contribute to serious social or environmental harms.” It also documents that the U.S. and other wealthy nations have been unwilling to accept these harms on their own soils.

Even if Newsom disregards the health of poor and slave laborers in other nations, electric vehicles are still not “zero-emission” for the people of California. This is because electric vehicles emit pollutants from road, tire, and brake wear, and these forms of pollution are worse in electric vehicles than standard cars. Per a 2016 paper in the journal Atmospheric Environment, “Electric vehicles are 24% heavier than their conventional counterparts,” and this creates more “non-exhaust emissions” like “tire wear, brake wear, road surface wear and resuspension of road dust.”

Greenhouse Gases

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary greenhouse gas emitted by human activity, and the 2021 paper in the Journal of Cleaner Production found that electric cars emit 48% less CO2 than gasoline-powered ones. Although this is lower, it is still far from “zero-emission.”

Moreover, a study published by the Ifo Institute of Germany in 2019 found that an electric Tesla Model 3 emits 11% to 28% more CO2 over its lifespan than a diesel Mercedes C220D. Again, LCAs are subject to uncertainty, and no single study is an end-all, but this clearly proves that electric vehicles are far from emission-free.

With no regard for those facts, Gavin Newsom asserts that “California now has a groundbreaking, world-leading plan to achieve 100% zero-emission vehicle sales” that will help “solve this climate crisis.”

Contrary to Newsom’s claim of a “climate crisis,” a wide array of environmental and human welfare measures related to climate change have stayed level or improved for more than three decades. This includes foliage productivity, extinction rates, forest cover, agricultural production, coastal flooding, rainfall and droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, and extreme weather fatalities. These empirical facts refute more than 30 years of failed predictions by global warming alarmists.

Newsom then adds another layer of deception by stating that the plan reduces “dangerous carbon emissions” that “pollute our communities.” This misportrays CO2 as a toxic, dirty substance. In reality, it is an organic, colorless, non-carcinogenic gas that has no toxic effects on humans until concentrations exceed at least 6 times the level in Earth’s atmosphere.

Referring to CO2 as “carbon” is also unscientific. That’s because CO2 is not carbon, just like H2O (water) is not hydrogen. There are more than 10 million different carbon compounds, and calling CO2 “carbon” conflates this relatively innocuous gas with highly noxious substances like carbon monoxide and black carbon.

In summary, there is no reliable evidence that greenhouse gas reductions from electric cars will benefit anyone.

Consequences

Like Newsom, the California Air Resources Board boasts that “100% of new cars and light trucks sold in California will be zero-emission vehicles” by 2035. Assuming Newsom and the board members have at least a rudimentary knowledge of electric cars, calling them “zero-emission vehicles” is a lie.

A Google search reveals that journalists and many others are also using this inherently false phrase.

The harms of this deceit extend well beyond pollution. This is because electric cars are more costly than other options, and that’s why people rarely buy electric cars unless governments subsidize or mandate them. As documented by a 2021 paper in the journal Transport and Environment:

Mass market adoption of electric vehicles will likely require either that governments restrict the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles (as planned in some countries and California) or that BEVs [battery electric vehicles] become cost-competitive with gasoline-powered vehicles of similar size and styling.

Regardless of whether these additional costs are paid by consumers or taxpayers, they make people poorer because these expensive cars ultimately travel fewer miles for every dollar spent.

The same applies to other “clean energy” policies that are prevalent in California. This is a major reason why it has the highest electricity prices in the continental U.S., or 77% more than the national average.

Such policies that increase the costs of living have contributed to making California the state with the highest real poverty rate in the nation.

Despite its “green” agenda, California dominates the American Lung Association’s list of cities with the poorest air quality in America. In fact, the nation’s worst four cities for ozone pollution, worst five cities for year-round particle pollution, and worst two cities for short-term particle pollution are all in California.

There are certainly many other factors besides energy policies that have led to those dreadful outcomes in California, but lying to people deprives them of the opportunity to make informed decisions about the pros and cons of these policies.","September 7, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/electric-cars-are-not-zero-emission-vehicles/
"Biden Energy Policies: Incoherent, Incompetent, Intolerable",Paul Driessen,"The U.S. Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision in West Virginia v. EPA is truly a landmark ruling. It decisively rejected the Environmental Protection Agency’s attempt to use vague, “previously little-used” language in the Clean Air Act to shutter America’s remaining coal-fired power plants and force the nation to switch to pseudo-renewable energy, in the name of ending the “manmade climate crisis.”

But the decision goes much further. The Court made it clear that federal agencies may not impose “major federal actions,” decide “major questions” or implement “transformative expansions” of their regulatory authority without specific statutory authority clearly conferred by Congress.

In other words, federal agencies do not have the power or right to take unilateral actions that effectively transform or undermine major sections of America’s energy, economic or agricultural systems, its industries or its living standards, unless Congress has given them explicit authority to do so.

Such enormously “transformational powers” belong to the American people, acting through legislators they elect to represent them – not to bureaucrats who are not elected and cannot easily be removed from office or otherwise disciplined and held accountable. The intolerable regulatory overreach exhibited by EPA (and too many other federal agencies) violates our Constitution, its “separation of powers” doctrine, and any rational understanding of “legislative intent.”

Many Americans believe West Virginia v. EPA represents a great victory over the regulatory “Deep State.” However, the Court’s ruling will mean little if the Biden Administration refuses to acknowledge the decision and continues doing as it pleases, perhaps reflecting the “progressive” view that the Court has gone “rogue.”

To cite just one example, consider what’s happening with regard to pipeline policy – yet another choke point the Administration is utilizing to force America to terminate fossil fuel use.

Richard Glick, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s radically left chairman, claims the ruling doesn’t apply to him. He insists that several federal district courts – two tiers below the Supreme Court – previously held that the EPA could regulate coal into oblivion. Therefore, he claims, the energy-killing regulations he wants to impose on pipelines can remain in place, or even be made more onerous, unless the Supreme Court specifically overrules him and FERC on that specific matter.

Under this “novel” interpretation, federal agencies can ignore or defy the Supreme Court on any regulations they want to implement – even regulations with major national implications, even rules that could leave people freezing jobless in the dark and perhaps dying from hypothermia – unless and until the Supremes render a decision specifically against those agencies and rules.

Or perhaps even until the Court has mustered its own army or sent an FBI or IRS SWAT team to kick in agency doors and enforce its decisions.

Chairman Glick wants FERC to revive its proposed rule requiring pipeline companies to account for all greenhouse gas emissions from construction or operation of their pipelines – even if it means many states and cities could find themselves without natural gas to electrify, heat and air condition homes, operate restaurants, hospitals and schools, power factories, or provide backup electricity during emergencies.

Major regions of America depend on pipelines carrying natural gas to generate electricity or provide direct fuel for furnaces, water heaters, ovens, ranges and backup generators. They already face threats of gas shortages and electricity blackouts during winter months and when weather conditions don’t cooperate with government-mandated wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations.

Pipeline companies say they would have to abandon many markets if the FERC rule is imposed, because it is hugely expensive, impossible to follow and likely to bankrupt them.

When Democrat and Republican members of Congress learned about the proposed rule, they urged FERC to rescind it. The Commission ultimately did suspend further consideration of the measure, but Mr. Glick’s recent remarks suggest he may try to unilaterally lift the suspension.

Perhaps his position is so at odds with the Supreme Court because the White House told him to disregard the ruling. President Biden repeatedly said on the campaign trail and since his inauguration that he is little concerned about high energy prices. He promised to end fossil fuel use in the USA and intends to do so, regardless of any impacts that might have on families, jobs and global geopolitical realities.

President Biden promptly canceled the Keystone Pipeline, increased regulations, suspended federal permitting processes, designated large areas as “national monuments” to restrict exploration and production, and directed all federal agencies to base all decisions on theoretical effects on Earth’s climate.

Those actions clearly signaled that he was willing to sacrifice our nation’s hard-won energy independence and once-strong economy on the altar of extreme green ideologies.

When food and gasoline prices more than doubled and inflation shot to a 40-year high, his approval ratings sank to lows never endured by any American president, Mr. Biden was reduced to begging Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran to produce more oil. Perhaps he thinks their fossil fuels don’t emit “carbon.”

With a deciding vote by Vice President Kamala Harris, Congress passed the fraudulently named Inflation Reduction Act, which slaps $370-billion in taxes on middle class families to pay for electric vehicle, solar panel and wind turbine tax credits – and further enrich Democrat allies.

The wealthy will buy expensive electric cars that will be charged with pricey, intermittent, weather-dependent wind and solar power. Middle classes will see their jobs and living standards plunge further.

Meanwhile, China, India, a hundred other developing countries and a newly refocused Europe are all burning more fossil fuels, to improve and safeguard people’s living standards and lives – and provide the “renewable” energy materials and technologies the United States cannot or will not produce itself.

The United States could totally eliminate coal, oil and natural gas – and it wouldn’t improve Earth’s climate or weather one iota, even if greenhouse gas emissions actually drive climate change, including the Ice Ages, Roman and Medieval Warm Periods, Little Ice Age, Mayan drought and Dust Bowl.

Even more interesting, incoherent, incompetent and intolerable, White House and FERC actions to base all federal decisions on computer-conjured effects on Earth’s global climate obstinately and deliberately ignore the widespread harmful effects of Biden Administration fossil-fuel-eradication policies.

Those policies pay little or no attention to slave and child labor, wildlife habitat destruction, toxic air and water pollution, or even carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from the vast overseas mining, materials processing and manufacturing operations required to make the countless wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles and backup batteries needed to replace the fossil fuels Mr. Biden detests.

Moreover, the fact that Mr. Glick’s boss has an anti-fossil-fuel agenda does not mean FERC’s chairman can ignore and defy America’s highest court. He swore to respect our Constitution and the separation of powers enshrined in it. He has no right or authority to advance the ideological whims of political officeholders, even a President.

Chairman Glick’s past comments show he already understands this. If he pushes his pipeline rule now on climate grounds, it will spell trouble – for American families, and for our Constitution, judicial system, regulatory state, respect for the rule of law, and survival as a united nation.

We hope he musters the courage, common sense and recognition of his oath of office to do what is constitutional, as opposed to what’s momentarily convenient, albeit incomprehensible. But that’s highly unlikely. So keep this destructive Biden agenda in mind when you head to the polls November 8.","September 7, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/biden-energy-policies-incoherent-incompetent-intolerable/
Is the Automobile Industry Being Mandated Toward a Death Spiral?,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The few healthy and wealthy countries of the United States of America, Germany, the UK, and Australia representing 6 percent of the world’s population (505 million vs 7.8 billion) that are mandating social changes to achieve zero emissions may be fueling (no pun intended) a death spiral for the automobile industry.

Simply put, in these healthy and wealthy countries, every person, animal, or anything that causes emissions to harmfully rise could vanish off the face of the earth; or even die off, and global emissions will still explode in the coming years and decades ahead over the population and economic growth of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam, and Africa.

We will look at each of the “pieces of the EV puzzle” that may be the formula for an automobile industry death spiral:

Extremely limited supply chain for the lithium to make current technology EV batteries Lack of sufficient number of buyers, outside the elite profile of existing EV owners Shortage and inflation for all the material supplies to make vehicles. Due to EV battery fire potentials, questionable means of transporting EV from foreign manufacturers to the USA. Concern about renewable electricity being able to charge EV batteries. The Governments’ lack of ethical, moral, and social responsibilities, by encouraging the exploitations of people with yellow, brown, and black skin that are mining for exotic minerals and metals in poorer developing countries to support the green movement in wealthy countries.

Where are the batteries?

While the race is on to produce more lithium in the United States as the supply chain for the major component of EV batteries, lithium, is already being compromised internationally. The following international dark clouds on the lithium supply chain may be a prelude to an American rejection of strip mining in the most environmentally regulated and controlled communities in the world:

The Chilean Supreme Court stopped the mining of lithium in Salar de Atacama, Chile – a huge chunk of terrain that holds 55 percent of the world’s known deposits of lithium.

Initiatives around the world to open mines and ore processing plants have caused a public uproar as environmentalists and the local population are fearful about the impact on nature and people’s livelihoods.

The European Chemicals Agency’s (ECHA) risk assessment committee is aiming at labelling three lithium compounds as dangerous for human health

Where are the buyers?

The current EV ownership profiles of the oligarchic elite that are highly educated, highly compensated, multi-car families, with low mileage requirements for the families second car, are dramatically different from most vehicle owners that are single-car owners, not highly educated, nor highly compensated. Mandating a change to EV ownership and forced austerity may face a rebellion from those that need transportation.

Where is the transportation from the foreign manufacturers to the car dealers?

In 2019, China, Japan, India, Germany, and South Korea were manufactured more than 50 million vehicles compared to the 11 million that were manufactured in the USA

Bringing those foreign built cars to America may be an insurmountable insurance problem. The Felicity Ace, a 650-foot-long cargo ship carrying hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of luxury cars sunk in March 2022. The salvage crew working on the burning ship said electric-vehicle batteries were part of the reason it was still aflame after several days. T he estimated market value of the Felicity Ace was $24.5 million, while the total value of the 3965 vehicles were over $500 million.

With potential fires from EV batteries in vehicles, who is going to take the insurance responsibility for their safe passage from the foreign manufacturers to American ports, the cargo ships, or the manufacturers?

Where are the vehicle materials?

Most people do not know that crude oil is useless unless it can be manufactured into something usable. All the material for the EV, from electronics, plastics, glass, leather, tires, etc. are all made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

Today’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels are all the rage to divest in all fossil fuels. ESG is working but will result in shortages and inflation as the new norm as society’s demands for the products from crude oil are exceeding the supply from the diminishing number of manufacturers.

There were almost 700 oil refineries in the world as of January 2020, but as a result on continuous over regulations, permitting delays, aging equipment, over the next five years 20 percent of the them are projected to close. That is a whopping 140 manufacturers that will close. Shortages and inflation in perpetuity may be the new norm as society’s demands for the products manufactured from crude oil are continually exceeding the supply from the diminishing number of manufacturers.

Where is the electricity?

The government’s zest for zero emissions electricity in favor of intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine are eliminating coal fired and natural gas power plants that have been generating continuous uninterruptable electricity.

We have all read about the concerns toward “grid stability” to be able to charge those EV batteries. Well, the UK may have given the world a heads-up on why electricity rates may be rising in perpetuity.

In the UK, their concerns for grid stability with fewer and fewer continuous uninterruptible power generations facilities has implemented regulations that went into force in June 2022, that restrict charging times.

In the UK, new chargers in the home and workplace now automatically switch off in peak times to avoid potential blackouts. New UK chargers are pre-set to not function during 9-hours of peak loads, from 8am to 11am (3-hours), and 4pm to 10pm (6-hours).

In addition, all home installed UK electric vehicle chargers are required to be separately metered and send this information to a Smart meter data communications network. Potentially, this UK legislation allows the electricity used for charging EVs to be charged and taxed at a higher rate than domestic electricity. Obviously, the EV electricity users are the ones that will be paying to upgrade and maintain the grid.

Where is the ethical, moral, and socially responsibility for the lithium supplies to meet the mandate toward EV’s?

The Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy , does an excellent job of discussing the lack of transparency to the environmental degradation and humanity atrocities occurring in developing countries mining for those exotic minerals and metals to support the “green” movement.

The subsidies to purchase EV’s are financial incentives to encourage further exploitations of yellow, brown, and black skin residents in developing countries. Are those subsidies ethical, moral, and socially responsible to those being exploited?

In summary, the passion of the few wealthy countries to achieve zero emissions at any cost, will face major supply chain issues of lithium and all body parts, affordability, safety from spontaneous fires, availability and affordability of electricity from breezes and sunshine, and the ethical challenges that are exploiting folks in poorer countries, just for the elites to drive an EV manufactured by the few that survive the government mandated death spiral.","September 6, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/is-the-automobile-industry-being-mandated-toward-a-death-spiral/
Where Are All the Hurricanes? They Ain’t Here Yet,H. Sterling Burnett,"Editor’s Note: As numerous headlines and top stories in various corporate media outlets attested at the time, in May the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicted the 2022 hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin would be a busy one with above-normal numbers of hurricanes, possibly quite strong. As noted in a couple of Climate Realism posts recently, that prediction has not panned out. As I write this on August 30, not a single hurricane has formed in the Atlantic Basin since the official beginning of hurricane season on June 1. While not completely unprecedented, this is quite rare. Indeed, even the number of tropical storms and the length of time they were organized as named storms is well below average, this year.

Things may change, and they probably will. More tropical storms and even some hurricanes will almost undoubtedly form in the waning months of hurricane season 2022, but based on what we have seen thus far, it is highly likely NOAA’s ominous warning of more, more powerful storms in 2022 will fail to materialize—a fact for which we can all be thankful.

Heartland Senior Fellow and award-winning meteorologist Anthony Watts recently discussed the unusual—confounding to NOAA—hurricane season so far, how most mainstream media outlets are trying to downplay the good news about hurricanes with a “just watch out; its coming and its bad” spin, and what it says about predictions of climate disaster. Climate Change Weekly presents Watts’ article, in full, below.

‘Hurricane Season Slowest Start in 30 Years’—Media Spins ‘Damage Control’ Stories

Back in May, many media outlets ran with this headline courtesy of a press release from NOAA:

NOAA predicts above-normal 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Season

Media outlets like Houston Public Media trumpeted it as if it were fact, saying, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released its 2022 Atlantic Hurricane Forecast, predicting an “above normal” hurricane season. NOAA says there is a 70 percent chance of 14-21 storms forming, with as many as ten potentially becoming hurricanes. Three to six of these storms could become major hurricanes. … NOAA administrator Dr. Rick Spinrad said the past two hurricane seasons were “extremely active” and the first to run out of their annual 21 storm names in back-to-back years. Spinrad also detailed the improvements that NOAA forecasts have made over the past few years. He attributed their advancements to NOAA’s weather forecast system, Hurricane Hunter flight data, and the administration’s ability to accurately pinpoint at-risk areas. “Along with better science, we’ll ultimately make way for better hurricane forecast model guidance for years to come,” Spinrad said.

That “better science” has so far been a bust. The problem is, as nearly three months have elapsed since the official start of hurricane season on June 1, not one has yet materialized.

As The Weather Channel (TWC) reported this week, “It’s The Atlantic Hurricane Season’s Least Active Start In 30 Years”

TWC made some succinct points:

By one metric, the start of the 2022 hurricane season is the least active since 1992.

Two recent Gulf disturbances failed to become tropical depressions or storms.

Activity is expected to pick up in the coming weeks. … While the number of storms isn’t pacing far below the season-to-date average, Colorado State University tropical scientist Phil Klotzbach pointed out it was the first time in 40 years that no named storms formed from July 3–August 22 in the Atlantic Basin. … As of Aug. 20, the 2022 hurricane season’s ACE index is pacing at the lowest of any year since 1992, according to Kim Wood, associate professor at Mississippi State University. Short for Accumulated Cyclone Energy, the ACE index sums up how long storms last and how intense they become, instead of just raw counts of storms.

Each of the Atlantic Basin’s three storms was relatively weak and short-lived, though Bonnie went on to become a hurricane in the Eastern Pacific Basin.

That ACE value, tracked by hurricane expert Dr. Ryan Maue, showed a marked drop to just 24% of normal for the year to date, as seen highlighted in this table:

Both NOAA and the media have now gone into damage control mode, insisting with a new press release on August 4, 2022, that with the “better science” they claim they have, it could still happen.

Some of the headlines included:

Yet now, after almost four weeks have passed, there have been no hurricanes, no tropical storms, not even a significant disturbance.

According to this graphic from the National Hurricane Center, taken at 1:37 PM EDT Fri Aug 26, 2022, the Atlantic is devoid of any storms at all:

We are often told by climate experts and climate activists to “follow the science,” but when science fails to produce accurate forecasts, who should we follow then?

GLOBAL WARMING? NOT IN AUSTRALIA … WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE ADVISOR PUNISHED FOR CORRUPTION … GEOENGINEERING TO REMOVE CARBON DIOXIDE PROPOSED

GLOBAL WARMING? NOT IN AUSTRALIA

The Quadrant reports the system of satellites crossing high above Australia, maintained by the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH) for the past 40 years, has recorded no warming over the continent for the past decade.

Through June 2022, the UAH’s satellites have recorded no warming for seven years and 10 months globally, either. According to The Quadrant, the UAH’s temperature records are confirmed by the ground-based HadCRUT series, which have recorded no warming for 86 months.

The Quadrant reports the data from the satellites is not cherry-picked but instead “is calculated by a method taking all months into account. Indeed it’s the method recommended by the godfather of global temperature measuring, Prof Phil Jones of the early HadCRUT global temperature series, also of 2009 Climategate email fame.”

Of note is the fact that not a single climate model managed to forecast the present pause in warming.

In addition, the UAH satellite record is

consistent with independent data from radiosonde measurements on weather balloons. Thousands of these balloons are launched every day. On the global scale, satellite coverage is, of course, vastly superior to the three main terrestrial global temperature measuring systems HadCRUT, NASA-GISS and NOAA, which lack coverage of significant areas of the earth’s surface. Gaps includes the poles, large ocean areas, and much of Siberia and the African continent’s 30 million square kilometres.

WHITE HOUSE SCIENCE ADVISOR PUNISHED FOR CORRUPTION

The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has barred Jane Lubchenco, deputy director for climate and environment at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, from participating in activities or publications for five years, for violating the academy’s code of conduct.

The NAS found Lubchenco, a marine biologist, violated section 3 of its code of conduct, which requires members to “avoid those detrimental research practices that are clear violations of the fundamental tenets of research.”

Before joining the Biden administration, Lubchenco served in a variety of positions in academia, at research institutes, and in government, including Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during the administration of President Barack Obama; president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS; 1997-1998); with the International Council for Science (ICSU; 2002-2005); with the Ecological Society of America (1992-1999); and two terms as a presidentially nominated, Senate-confirmed member of the National Science Board (1996-2006); and was elected to the Council of the National Academy of Sciences and appointed to its Executive Committee. In addition, Lubchenco has served on the editorial boards of many of the major journals in her field, helping determine which articles are considered for publication and selecting which researchers are chosen to peer-review articles submitted to the journals.

The NAS’s censure of Lubchenco was based on a paper the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) was forced to retract in 2021. The Washington Post described the infraction as follows: “While serving as an editor for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Lubchenco accepted an article for publication that was later retracted because it relied on outdated data, and because she has a personal relationship with one of the authors, who is her brother-in-law.” Both of those factors were violations of NAS policies. The NAS also noted Lubchenco had “recently published a related paper with the article’s authors.” Lubchenco had failed to disclose her personal connections to and work with the authors, a clear conflict of interest when choosing to decide whether to accept the paper for publication and editing it.

Lubchenco has been leading the Biden administration’s efforts to develop and standardize scientific integrity policies across government agencies. Talk about the fox guarding the henhouse!

The NAS created its code of conduct in 2018 and has since permanently expelled three members for violating it. Permanent suspension was the only punishment available. While Lubchenco was being investigated and her actions being judged, however, on June 24 the NAS altered its code to allow temporary suspensions. Lubchenco’s punishment under the NAS’s conduct code is the lightest handed out to date. One might conclude standards of conduct are different if one is a member of a presidential administration that controls millions of dollars in research funding.

According to Axios, the American Accountability Foundation has called on Lubchenco to resign or be fired.

“The American people deserve leaders in the White House who don’t use their positions of influence to put their thumb on the scales for friends and family. Dr. Jane Lubchenco does not meet that standard and does not deserve to be an Assistant to the President,” AAF founder Tom Jones said in a statement.

GEOENGINEERING TO REMOVE CARBON DIOXIDE PROPOSED

With 50 times more carbon dioxide in the ocean than in the atmosphere, and with oceans covering about 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, some researchers are reexamining whether the oceans can, with a little help from humans, remove and store more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and create more-favorable conditions for sea life in the process.

A group of scientists released a report through the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) in 2021 on various geoengineering possibilities to reduce the presumed threat of climate change. One option they examined was boosting phytoplankton production by introducing iron, an important nutrient for plankton, to the water. As a story in the Daily Beast notes, many parts of the ocean are low in iron. In those locations, called dead spots, even a relatively small addition of iron has been shown to produce large amounts of phytoplankton, removing a disproportionate amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the process. It also jumpstarts the food chain in those locations.

Ken Buesseler, a marine radiochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, has researched ocean iron fertilization and was part of the team that wrote the NAS report. Buesseler and his colleagues found introducing iron into the ocean can sequester a large amount of carbon dioxide. His team estimates adding abundant waste iron, such as iron filings from industrial activities, into the oceans could, on a “very conservative” estimate, sequester as much as a gigaton of carbon dioxide each year.

According to scientists interviewed by the Daily Beast, it wouldn’t be hard or require a lot of resources to produce big, almost immediate results: phytoplankton blooms can form within 24 hours of the introduction of iron into under-mineralized areas of the ocean:

David Siegel, a professor of marine science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told The Daily Beast that iron fertilization would also be pretty easy to do. You could simply get a 120-foot fishing boat and start deploying the iron where it’ll be most effective for stimulating phytoplankton growth. “It can be done relatively cheaply. Each atom of iron that you add in the right places can make tens of thousands of atoms of carbon get fixed,” meaning absorbed by the water. “It’s rather efficient,” Siegel said. “You can deploy vessels that release iron oxide into the water—even just iron ore into the water—and you can make blooms that you can see from space. We know that.”

Renewables Subsidy Chaos Coming,David Wojick,"A funny thing happened on the way to the Senate. It is all about the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which really should be named the Inflation Act. Only Democrats can believe that raising taxes reduces inflation.

The Democrats writing the IRA decided that since tax credit subsidies do a good job of promoting renewables and electric vehicles, they should do more. They should promote things like union wages, mining and manufacturing, which have nothing to do with climate.

Think of it as social engineering squared. In the vernacular this is called “mission creep.” A program designed to do one thing tries to do something very different, often unsuccessfully.

In the process, the tax credit rules have become very complex. The funny thing is that these complexities may actually stifle the growth of renewables and electric vehicles (EVs).

Let’s just look at renewables and wages. The IRA takes a two step approach. First it cuts the tax credit subsidy by 80%, which is certainly not going to promote growth. In fact it could eliminate growth entirely since most developers of big wind and solar projects are only doing it because of the subsidies.

Step two then restores the tax credits under certain specific circumstances. Chief among these is that the construction of the project must be carried out entirely by contractors and subcontractors that pay all their laborers and mechanics what are called “prevailing wages.”

This sort of prevailing wage requirement is common for certain federal projects so the concept is well established. It typically means union wages, which can be significantly higher than what non-union contractors pay. Biden has repeatedly bragged about creating union jobs and this is what he is talking about, even though the word “union” is not used. The required amount of such wages is determined by the Secretary of Labor on a local basis.

Wages have nothing to do with climate and this is a wide ranging new requirement for the industry. Implementing it will be difficult and may create some serious problems. This is especially true because subcontractors are included, making the scope quite large.

To begin with the project owner will have to determine that every contractor pays the correct wages. In addition every contractor will have to make this determination for every one of its subcontractors, passing this assurance on to the owner.

An elaborate certification process will likely be necessary since large amounts of money are at stake. A single subcontractor not paying enough wages could get all the tax credits cancelled. In addition there are hefty financial penalties.

A bigger problem may be that some, or even many, potential contractors or subcontractors will not want to increase their wages just to work on a renewables project. Finding those that will, could seriously delay a project, or even render it unworkable.

Here is a theoretical example. Wind tower foundations take a great deal of concrete. This might mean contracting with a firm to set up and operate what is called a batch plant, which makes concrete on site. Given that wind arrays are typically built in remote areas the number of available blanch plant contractors could be quite small. They might not want to up the wages they pay just for this project.

Then too, the subcontractors in this case include the cement maker, gravel vendor, and maybe a water seller that supply the batch plant, possibly also one or more trucking firms to deliver the stuff. Each of these firms would have to determine and pay the prevailing wages, which some might not care to do.

This is the problem with prescriptive social engineering that is essentially voluntary. People can decide not to do it.

On top of this, there is another problem that is potentially much bigger. The law says that if there is a low wages noncompliance the cancellation of the credits and the penalties are both on the taxpayer. But many of these tax credits are sold to people with big incomes and firms with big profits.

In this case it is the buyers that get hammered, not the wind and solar companies that sold them the credits. Every buyer is at risk that it will later be found out that some subcontractor failed to pay the official prevailing wage. They could lose their entire investment plus be subject to serious penalties and interest. That is a lot of risk.

This new risk has got to have a seriously chilling effect on the market for renewables’ tax credits, which could greatly reduce the growth.

Moreover under the same IRA, the IRS is being heavily funded to greatly increase its audits of big ticket taxpayers, which the renewables tax credit purchasers undoubtedly are. This makes the risk even greater. How this risk can be reduced remains to be seen.

In this case the audits should include the wages paid by the contractors and subcontractors, since the validity of the tax credits depends on these wages. This might be another reason why firms might not want to work on renewables construction projects, especially small businesses that cannot afford audits.

In short, turning the renewables tax credit program into an instrument to raise wages and support unions might wind up seriously hurting the industry. The new complexities and risks are daunting at best. Chaos is likely in the short run. Stay tuned.

“Inflation Reduction” Act Will Hinder EV Growth,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","After his mandate to transition to electric vehicles (EVs), President Joe Biden then signed The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that requires EVs to contain a battery pack and other parts built in North America with minerals mined or recycled in America. With the chance of strip mining for lithium in America being slim to nil, no EVs will qualify for the tax credits in the IRA.

Biden’s goal of 50% EV sales by 2030 will test lithium supply chains and the economic strength of the American society to meet those projections without any subsidies to procure those vehicles.

While the race is on to produce more lithium in the United States as the supply chain for the major component of EV batteries, lithium, is already being compromised internationally. The following international dark clouds on the lithium supply chain may be a prelude to an American rejection of strip mining in the most environmentally regulated and controlled communities in the world:

A proposal by the European Chemicals Agency’s (ECHA) risk assessment committee is aimed at labelling three lithium compounds as dangerous for human health. The compounds include lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide. The final decision is expected to be made in late 2022 or early 2023.

Earlier in 2022, Chinese EV giant BYD Co. won a government contract to mine lithium in Salar de Atacama, Chile – a huge chunk of terrain that holds 55% of the world’s known deposits of lithium. But before the company could tap into that resource, indigenous residents took to the streets and demanded the tender to be canceled over concerns about the impact on local water supplies. In June, the Chilean Supreme Court threw out the award, saying the government failed to consult with indigenous people first. In America, we call these local and environmentalist folks, NIMBY’s (Not-In-My-Back-Yard).

Initiatives to open mines and ore processing plants such as the ones in Serbia and Portugal have caused a public uproar as environmentalists and the local population are fearful about the impact on nature and people’s livelihoods. In other projects, engineers are trying to make the extraction of lithium from geothermal waters cost effective and harmless, without any mining. Currently, Portugal has called off a lithium project amid EU’s scramble for battery materials.

Due to potential fires, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prohibits in checked baggage, spare (uninstalled) lithium metal batteries and lithium-ion batteries, electronic cigarettes and vaping devices. They must be carried with the passenger in carry-on baggage. Smoke and fire incidents involving lithium batteries can be mitigated by the cabin crew and passengers inside the aircraft cabin.

Since you’ve probably read about EV fires, here’s a site that keeps tabs just on TESLA EV fires, Tesla Fires as of 8/19/2022 were 97 confirmed cases and Fatalities Involving a Tesla Car Fire count were 38. Shockingly, while the Feds are banning lithium batteries in checked luggage on planes due to potential fires, Biden is pushing them for vehicles.

The actions of the Biden government and the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels movement are currently supportive of jumping onto the EV train, but Biden and the “ESG-ers” may be oblivious that EVs have a very dark side of environmental atrocities, and the non-existing transparency of human rights abuses occurring in other countries. Both are directly connected to the mining for the exotic minerals and metals that are required to manufacture wind turbines, solar panels, and EV batteries.

The Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy,” (which I co-authored with Todd Royal) does an excellent job of discussing the lack of transparency to the environmental degradation and humanity atrocities occurring in developing countries mining for those exotic minerals and metals to support the “green” movement. The subsidies to purchase EVs are financial incentives to encourage further exploitations of yellow, brown, and black skin residents in developing countries. Are those subsidies ethical?

Amid tougher emissions regulations worldwide, established automakers are racing to add more EVs to their lineup. A Reuters analysis found that global automakers such as Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Fiat, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Daimler, and Chrysler plan to spend a combined US $300 billion on EVs over the next decade as car companies are betting big on EVs. Most of the EVs will be manufactured in foreign countries far removed from American ports.

China came from zero production in 1950, to 2019 where it now produces more cars than the USA, Japan, and India collectively. The 6-minute video of the automobile manufacturing “needle” shows how the foreign manufacturing dominance occurred over that 69-year period.

Automobiles manufactured per year, 1950 – 2019:

China: None – 28 million

United States: 8 million – 11 million

Japan: 31 thousand – 9.8 million

India: 15 thousand – 5 million

Germany: 300 thousand – 5 million

South Korea: None – 4 million

Bringing those foreign built cars to America may be an insurmountable insurance problem. The Felicity Ace, a 650-foot-long cargo ship carrying hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of luxury cars sunk in March 2022. The salvage crew working on the burning ship said electric-vehicle batteries were part of the reason it was still aflame after several days. The estimated market value of the Felicity Ace was $24.5 million, while the total value of the 3965 vehicles could be over $500 million.

With potential fires from EV batteries in vehicles, who’s going to take the insurance responsibility for their safe passage from the foreign manufacturers to American ports, the cargo ships, or the manufacturers?

How dirty is lithium strip mining? Since the mineral contains dangerous substances, the mining process also contaminates the local water basins. Lithium extraction exposes the local ecosystems to poisoning and other related health problems. How many Americans want strip mining for lithium in their backyard to view the environmental degradation from leach fields which are part of the extraction efforts?

The number of electric cars on the world’s roads at the end of 2021 was about 16.5 million, or just slightly more than 1% of the 1.4 billion vehicles in the world. With lithium production being setback internationally, EV growth will be hindered as locals’ revolt over lithium mining impacts on water supplies and environmental degradation in their communities.

China Scraps (Already Scant) Climate Cooperation Over Pelosi Taiwan Visit,H. Sterling Burnett,"The Chinese Communist Party was very displeased with U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) well-publicized visit to Taiwan reaffirming the United States’ commitment to the island’s continued independence from mainland China. To demonstrate its displeasure—in addition to the usual rattling of sabers, sending of new naval ships into the area, flying jets into Taiwanese airspace, and test-firing missiles into the sea around the island—China announced it was suspending cooperation with the United States in the fight against climate change. Heaven forbid!

After managing to control my uproarious laughter about China’s announcement, the first thought that popped into my mind was, what cooperation?

Dialogue and discussions have certainly done nothing thus far to reduce China’s greenhouse gas emissions, which are more than twice as great as those of the United States, and growing. China emits more greenhouse gases than every other industrialized country on the planet combined. Mouthing empty platitudes about the need to work together to fight climate change does not fight climate change, even if one truly believes people can stop climate change.

As should be the case in every country (and as Donald Trump tried to do for America), China’s leaders have looked out for what they consider to be their nation’s best interests during every round of climate meetings and in treaty and agreement negotiations since 1995. At the very first Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Berlin, China declared it would always count itself as a developing country in climate change agreements. That meant China would be exempt from mandatory greenhouse gas emission reductions. Regardless of what it has said in public since then, the Chinese government has never wavered from this position.

China played the rest of the world’s leaders like a drum during the negotiations for the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015. In an agreement that included no mandatory reductions except what countries imposed on themselves, all China would concede was that it expected its emissions to peak by 2030, maybe 2035. Climate negotiators and leaders of environmental NGOs hailed this as a historic step. Climate realists such as I asked: Peak at what level? Chinese Communist Party leaders smirked behind their hands at their PR coup. Our question has gone unanswered to this day.

If one believes, as I do not, that human greenhouse gas emissions are driving dangerous climate change, the question of where China’s emissions will peak, if they peak at all, is critical. By the UN’s own calculations, a doubling of China’s emissions would be game over for the world even if every developed country reaches net zero. Even if China’s emissions rise by only 15 to 25 percent, that would swamp any emission reductions from the West. And this is without accounting for what is going on in India, Indonesia, and other fast-developing countries. Emissions globally will greatly surpass the amount that would allegedly bring on the 2℃ temperature rise that Paris negotiators and climate NGOs claimed to be the point of no return for the planet.

Since then, China has embarked on a rapid further expansion of its fleet of coal-fueled power plants, its heavy industry (needing massive amounts of concrete and energy), and its military, all increasing China’s carbon dioxide emissions.

As I reported in Climate Change Weekly 433, China’s cabinet approved a plan this April to raise coal production by 300 million tons in 2022 alone, equal to 7 percent of the nation’s entire 2021 output. This after China increased coal production 5.7 percent above 2020’s output in 2021.

As NPR noted at the time, cabinet officials came out of the meeting saying, “Coal is important for ‘energy security.'” Simultaneously, the Chinese government announced plans to build new coal-fueled power plants to shore up the nation’s power supply.

That’s what China is doing, while saying it now expects to hit net zero by 2060. With this ongoing buildout of modern coal-power plants with productive lives that meet or exceed 50 years, no one can seriously believe China will shut down its new, expensive electric power plants prematurely and stunt or slow its economic growth.

Almost anyone with a functioning brain cell knows actions speak louder than words. China’s actions have spoken volumes about its “cooperation” with the United States and the rest of the world in the fight against purported climate change. Long before Pelosi set foot on Taiwanese soil, it was clear China is on the side of climate change if greenhouse gas emissions are indeed causing climate change. China is emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as fast as its energy system and industrial facilities can churn them out.

FOSSIL FUEL BANS HURT WOMEN, POOR … PACIFIC CYCLONES TRENDING DOWN … EUROPE’S VEGETABLE OIL USE GROWING, AS ARE EMISSIONS

FOSSIL FUEL BANS HURT WOMEN, POOR

A paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature says fighting climate change by banning or significantly limiting the use of fossil fuels harms the poor, especially poor women.

Paper author Vijaya Ramachandran, director of energy and development studies at California’s Breakthrough Institute, notes as many as 2.6 billion people, primarily in developing countries, experience energy poverty—”the lack of access to clean fuels”—and as a result end up cooking “on open fires or stoves using kerosene, coal, wood, animal waste or other forms of biomass.”

Each year, more than 3.8 million people die prematurely from illnesses linked to household air pollution, often resulting from cooking with biomass. This means more deaths can be tied to illnesses related to biomass use than from tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDS combined.

Poor women and young girls account for a disproportionate number of the biomass-related illnesses and deaths, because they do most of the cooking and household chores. Even if not killed or made ill, these women “lose time, security, and income because they must gather fuel; girls who might otherwise go to school go out to collect wood or cow pats.”

A modern electric grid powered by fossil fuels and nuclear, plus modern appliances burning natural gas, looks like the best hope for alleviating poverty and improving these women’s lives in the long run. Millions of women have already by been saved by the adoption of appliances using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). However, Ramachandran points out, expansion of these improvements, especially electrification, is being hampered by developed countries’ efforts to ban financing of projects that use fossil fuels. Ramachandran concludes,

Policymakers from rich countries might say they support women’s empowerment, but to me they seem more interested in simplistic climate mitigation—and coercing smaller nations to make cuts and compromises—than in improving the lives of poorer women. The irony is that clean cooking fuels are much better for the environment than standard fuels. Black carbon, although a short-lived pollutant, has a warming impact on the climate many times greater than that of carbon dioxide.

PACIFIC CYCLONES TRENDING DOWN

We in the United States pay careful attention to tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic Basin each year, and we hear much less about Pacific typhoons. Data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) shows typhoons in the Pacific have been trending downward for 70 years.

Even though the world has modestly warmed over the past century, data from the JMA going back to 1951 demonstrate a declining trend for Pacific typhoons forming in the month of July in particular, and from January to July more generally, No Tricks Zone reports. A picture is worth a thousand words, so here are two figures plotted using JMA data:

“This is the opposite of what climate ‘experts’ said would happen,” reports No Tricks Zone. The Pacific typhoon trend measured by the JMA is consistent with trends of Atlantic basin tropical storms and hurricanes, as discussed in Climate Change Weekly 439.

EUROPE’S VEGETABLE OIL USE GROWING, AS ARE EMISSIONS

Government mandates are causing drivers in Europe and the United Kingdom to use the equivalent of 17,000 tons—about 19 million bottles—of cooking oil and 14 million gallons of palm and soy oil for fuel every day, The Guardian reports. Those fuels are as much 250 percent more expensive than they were before 2021, in part because of the war in Ukraine, Europe’s largest supplier of rapeseed and the world’s largest source of sunflower oil. Much of the palm and soy oil are from Indonesia and South America, respectively, shipped to the EU in vessels and vehicles using fossil fuels.

Those interviewed by The Guardian complained vegetable oils and the crops used to produce them are being diverted from supermarkets to fuel-manufacturing during an ongoing food supply crisis.

The Guardian reports, “‘Supermarkets have had to ration vegetable oils and prices are soaring,’ said Maik Marahrens from the campaign group Transport & Environment, which carried out the research. “At the same time, we are burning thousands of tons of sunflower and rapeseed oil in our cars daily. In a time of scarcity we must prioritize food over fuel.”

The study cited by The Guardian reports “about 10% of the world’s grains are … turned into biofuels, enough to feed 1.9 billion people for a year on some estimates.”

A second study states, “If the land abroad used to grow the UK’s bioethanol were instead given over to food crops, an extra 3.5 million people a year could be fed.”

Leaders of some environmental groups have belatedly concluded burning food for fuel is immoral.

“At a time when Russia’s war threatens people in less developed countries with starvation, it’s indefensible to keep increasing biofuel use,” Dustin Benton, the Green Alliance’s policy director, told The Guardian. “Cutting back on biofuels is the fastest way of addressing global hunger in this crisis.”

Adding insult to injury, the lifecycle emissions from converting land, harvesting, distilling, transporting, and burning vegetable-based fuels can be even greater than those from fossil fuel use, because the fuel crops are often grown on previously unfarmed land or displace virgin forests, The Guardian reports.

“The cost of biofuels is greater than the benefit from any reduced use of oil,” Timothy Searchinger, a Princeton University scholar and senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, told The Guardian. “The error Europe and others have made is that they ignore this cost entirely. They act as though using land were free. The food crisis we are in reminds us that is not true.”

Reliable Wind and Solar Are not Cheap,David Wojick,"You often hear that wind and solar power are cheaper than burning coal or natural gas, so we will save money by switching. But as the song says, it ain’t necessarily so. In fact it is almost never so. That wind and solar are cheaper is at best a half truth, more like an eighth truth.

Here is the reality you never hear of.

That wind and solar are cheaper is true in one way, but it is a small way. It is also a technical way, with the grand name of the “levelized cost of electricity” or LCOE. Now “levelized” is not a word you hear every day, to say the least. This might tip you off that something is going on.

In fact LCOE, as it is always called, is a simple idea. It is usually calculated (or estimated) for a single electric power generator. This might be a coal or gas fired power plant, or for a wind farm or solar array. You first take the total cost over the entire life of the generator. This includes construction, operation and retirement or disposal. You then divide this cost by all the juice it generates in that lifetime. The answer is the LCOE for that generator.

So LCOE is the cost of making the juice. What levelized means is that the ups and downs over time are not part of it. They are all mashed into a single number.

For the big, utility scale, generators the cost is usually in dollars and the juice in megawatt hours or MWh. An average house uses around one MWh a month. America as a whole uses around 4 billion MWh a year. That is a lot of juice.

Individual generator costs can vary from case to case, making LCOE something of a crude estimate. Below is a recent version of an international assessment, using the lowest numbers.

Note that there are two different kinds of gas fired generator. What is called a simple cycle is basically just a jet engine spinning a generator. These are usually pretty small. Then there is the “combined cycle” power plant where the hot jet exhaust makes steam that drives another generator. Most of our gas fired generation is combined cycle. Simple cycle is used when a boost of power is needed for a short time.

Likewise there are two types of wind generator, depending on where they are. Offshore wind towers are out in the ocean, which makes them expensive. Onshore wind is the familiar multi-tower wind complex on dry land. While Europe has a lot of offshore wind, America has almost none at this point. Several big projects are in the works. We are here just talking about onshore wind, which is relatively cheap.

Estimated average LCOE for various types of power plant in $/MWh.

Coal = $60

Simple cycle gas = $152

Combined cycle gas = $41

Solar = $36

Onshore wind = $29

You can see that solar and (onshore) wind are both cheaper than gas and coal. This is what is meant when people say wind and solar are cheaper. Their LCOE is lower.

However, when used in the grid to power America, wind and solar are far from cheaper. This is the fact that proponents of wind and solar like to ignore, or in many cases do not even know about.

In addition to the LCOE there is the high cost of making wind and solar reliable.

The basic fact is that coal and gas are reliable while wind and solar are not. What this means is that with coal and gas we can generate the electricity when we need it. We can rely on it. Wind and solar only generate when the wind blows strong and the sun shines bright. Since we cannot rely on wind and solar we have to have gas or coal generators standing by, ready to run when wind or solar don’t.

Having gas or coal fired power plants standing by is a big cost that is not included in LCOE. These generators could be supplying the power instead of the wind and solar, which would pay for them, but they are not. They are sitting there waiting to run, which still costs a lot of money. The big cost of these idle plants is part of the cost of wind and solar. It is the cost of reliability.

These idle gas and coal fired plants are not running just to make room for the power coming from the wind and solar generators. The cost of this deliberate idleness has a name in the industry. It is called the “capacity cost” because the amount of power a plant can produce is called its capacity. Since you are paying for the amount of generation needed to backup the wind and solar, that is the capacity cost of the backup.

Capacity cost is the reason that adding wind or solar generation (that must be used) drives up the price of electricity. This is why those States (and countries) with the most wind and solar tend to have very expensive electricity. The more wind and solar you have in the generation mix, the greater the capacity cost. Note that using batteries is not a realistic option, because the cost of backup batteries is far greater than the capacity cost.

In short, wind and solar are only cheaper if you ignore the cost of making them reliable. There is a lot of that going around. Don’t be fooled.

Politically Connected Piggies at the Trough for ‘Inflation’ Bill,H. Sterling Burnett,"The corporate media was effusive in its praise for the Schumer-Manchin green energy bill, grossly mislabeled the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As history attests and the last two years of profligate federal spending confirmed once again, government spending increases inflation instead of reducing it. When was the last time Congress increased spending while simultaneously reducing inflation? I’m waiting for your answer.

As implausible as the inflation reduction staging of the Democrats’ pork-filled bill of special-interest fodder is, the claims being made about its effect on greenhouse gas emissions are pure fantasy. The media keep parroting the claims by Senate Democrats and the White House that this bill will reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent by 2030, less than seven-and-a-half years from now (long after Biden and most of those passing it have left office). The media has called this this bill a “breakthrough,” “astonishing,” and the “[b]iggest US Climate Legislation Ever.”

I have well-known doubts about claims the United States must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. My assessment of the evidence indicates continued fossil fuel use will not cause a planetary emergency or anything like it. The best evidence further shows the policies imposed to restrict fossil fuel use will unnecessarily restrict freedom and impose higher costs on the economy than the harms they are meant to prevent. Having said that, I’ll admit I could be wrong.

What I am almost certainly not wrong about is that to hit the 40 percent reduction target, every regulation resulting from the bill and every dollar spent on subsidies will have to have the effect its authors say it will. People and companies will have to do exactly what Democrat senators expect of them and produce perfect results. Every electric car the bill can possibly subsidize must be built, purchased, and operate perfectly although they never have in the past. Every carbon-capture and -storage project must reduce emissions by the amount projected at economically competitive costs, although they never have in the past. Every wind and solar installation and the thousands of miles of transmission lines must be built quickly and operate at full capacity, although they never have in the past. Every building upgrade and high-efficiency appliance subsidized must be undertaken, completed or purchased, and function just as envisioned, although they never have in the past.

In other words, for the first time in history, Congress will have to have written a bill that functions perfectly as designed, with no human error, no state or local resistance, no lobbying undercutting the bill’s effect, no delays in construction, and no unintended costs or consequences. No perfection, no 40 percent reduction.

When was the last time anything designed by human minds, much less any policy imposed by government, worked perfectly as intended? I’m waiting for your answer.

The inducements the government is giving people to encourage us to buy electric cars, for example, are obviously unlikely to work. Electric vehicles are substantially more expensive than the more-capable vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (which are also far less prone to combust spontaneously). Research shows the average annual household income for those purchasing electric vehicles is more than $200,000. Ninety percent of the federal tax credit money for electric vehicles thus far has gone to Americans in the top 20 percent of income earners. That’s making the rich richer through a government program that makes the poor poorer.

Of EV purchases, many are second vehicles—after all, the wealthy can afford to keep an extra vehicle for use when they want to virtue-signal their green attitudes. Even then, when it is time to purchase a new vehicle, more than 20 percent of EV buyers switch back to fossil fuel powered cars and trucks.

The evidence shows EV tax credits represent nothing more than a giant transfer of wealth from low- and middle-income working people to the wealthy.

In statements about the bill, its Democratic shills say things will be different this time and the EV credits will benefit average people, in part by limiting the tax credits to the purchase of lower-cost EVs and by setting income limits on the households that can claim the credits.

That doesn’t solve the fundamental problem. EV prices are rising faster than those of gasoline and diesel powered vehicles, because of inflation and supply chain problems. If a low- or middle-income family, say somewhere in the range of $30,000 to $50,000 annual household income, couldn’t afford an EV that cost $10,000 to $15,000 more than a comparable fossil fuel powered model under the old subsidy scheme, they certainly won’t be able to afford the even-higher-priced EV now. Prices overall are increasing and draining the budgets of lower-income people, and the $7,500 EV credit hasn’t changed. That won’t enable more people to buy more-expensive vehicles that are difficult to keep powered absent widespread availability of additional expensive charging equipment. It will in fact do the opposite.

The news is even worse for those hoping the bill will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by causing widespread adoption of EVs. The auto industry is warning that provisions in the bill intended to shore up labor’s support for it will cut or eliminate the subsidies for most people. The Associated Press writes,

The auto industry is warning that the vast majority of EV purchases won’t qualify for a tax credit that large. That’s mainly because of the bill’s requirement that, to qualify for the credit, an electric vehicle must contain a battery built in North America with minerals mined or recycled on the continent. And those rules become more stringent over time—to the point where, in a few years, it’s possible that no EVs would qualify for the tax credit, says John Bozzella, CEO of the Alliance of Automotive Innovation, a key industry trade group. As of now, the alliance estimates that about 50 of the 72 electric, hydrogen or plug-in hybrid models that are sold in the United States wouldn’t meet the requirements. “The $7,500 credit might exist on paper,” Bozzella said in a statement, “but no vehicles will qualify for this purchase over the next few years.”

The AP notes, “the idea behind the requirement is to incentivize domestic manufacturing, build a robust battery supply chain in North America and lessen the industry’s dependence on overseas supply chains that could be subject to disruptions.” These are laudable goals that I have long endorsed. The critical minerals and rare earths necessary to make EVs are also critical for other technologies throughout modern society. Those supplies, however, are controlled by often-hostile economic and geopolitical rivals, primarily China and corrupt regimes such as those in Myanmar and the Congo, countries where their production is tied to horrible human rights abuses such as child and slave labor, and their mining and refining causes massive environmental destruction and harm to human health.

Even so, costs are not the primary factor limiting the production of the materials and finished products such as batteries and other parts for electric vehicles in the United States. Regulations are the big impediment, and under Biden they are getting more stringent, not less. It is nearly impossible to open a new mine in the United States, especially one that will involve the kind of environmental disruption necessary to tease out small particles of rare earths and critical minerals from the massive amount of overburden containing them. Even when the federal government approves a mine (rare in itself) with all necessary permits being granted, each mine faces dozens of lawsuits from environmental radicals and locals hoping to get it stopped. This delays mine projects for years and adds to the cost of bringing to market the minerals, much less the finished products using them. To hit the IRA’s targets, the mines would have to be open and operating now, not 10 years from now.

Environmental regulations also make it almost impossible to open a plant to refine rare minerals, even if they are mined here. Rare minerals mined outside of China almost always end up in China for refining. A July 2022 report from the Brookings Institution states,

China is the dominant player in global mineral processing. …

A best-case scenario would be characterized by geographic diversification of critical minerals supply chains, coupled with globally aligned statutory due diligence requirements to make these supply chains cleaner and greener. This would see the U.S. and Europe making considerable investments in and successfully building out their critical minerals supply chains, from mining to battery manufacturing. It would also entail China instituting mandatory due diligence requirements on critical minerals sourcing and global coordination among major players, including Beijing, Washington, and Brussels, to align these requirements. … As things stand, this best-case scenario looks unlikely. Considerable investment would be needed to build out critical minerals supply chains in the U.S. and Europe. Current planning, including that undertaken by the Biden administration in the U.S., is a step in the right direction, but it is unclear whether it is commensurate with the scale of the challenge.

Indeed, contrary to Brookings’ assessment and Biden’s rhetoric, the Biden administration is imposing new climate regulations on infrastructure development that are likely to make getting federal permits for mining and for industrial facilities even more difficult and expensive. Former President Donald Trump set hard limits on the time agencies had to process permits, and he limited the scope of environmental reviews to direct impacts. Biden has rescinded these changes. There simply isn’t enough federal financial support in the Schumer-Manchin monstrosity to encourage companies even to try to overcome the regulatory hurdles, much less start production in time to hit the 2030 emission reduction targets.

Those are the complications impeding just one, small portion of the IRA’s numerous provisions that must be successful if the bill is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030 as advertised.

Time and space don’t permit me to go through all the subsidies for green energy and infrastructure schemes contained in the bill, but they are just as likely to fail as the EV tax credits and for similar reasons.

The 40 percent reduction claims are pure wish fulfillment for alarmists, a way to claim “we won.” They will prove at least as false as the bill’s name.

CANADA’S TRUDEAU TARGETS FOOD FOR CLIMATE CUTS … ELECTRIC BUSES MANDATED, THEN WITHDRAWN AFTER FIRE IN CONNECTICUT

CANADA’S TRUDEAU TARGETS FOOD FOR CLIMATE CUTS

Not content to throttle the country’s energy industry with climate change regulations, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau intends to use climate regulations to hamstring the nation’s farmers, the National Post reports. Canada is following the lead of the Netherlands, Ireland, and Sri Lanka, where in the latter case harmful agricultural restrictions caused a 50 percent decline in farm production in single year, followed by riots and the fall of the government.

Trudeau has told Canadian farmers and ranchers they must cut back their greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the National Post says, “the government has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fertilizer use by 30 per cent as part of its overall effort to reduce Canada’s emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2030.”

In response to this threat announcement, Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister David Marit said, “We’re really concerned with this arbitrary goal,” the National Post reports. “The Trudeau government has apparently moved on from their attack on the oil and gas industry and has set their sights on Saskatchewan farmers.”

As the National Post notes, “Energy and food [are] the twin essentials of life and security.” If Trudeau’s policies come to fruition, it will probably mean a painful economic decline for Canada and further food and energy insecurity for its people and others around the world.

ELECTRIC BUSES MANDATED, THEN WITHDRAWN AFTER FIRE IN CONNECTICUT

Although Connecticut’s greenhouse gas emissions amount to far less than 0.1 percent of total global annual emissions, Gov. Ned Lamont signed the Clean Air Act on July 22 in a public ceremony to show his leadership on climate action to save the planet.

The Manhattan Contrarian reports a central feature of the state’s Clean Air Act “is to electrify the state’s fleet of vehicles, particularly its city buses and school buses.” The new law bars the purchase of new diesel-powered buses after 2023.

“There are approximately 800 buses that we are responsible for at the DOT that are being replaced with no-emissions electric models,” said state Transportation Commissioner Joe Giuletti at the July 22 event. “They’re quieter, they emit no emissions, and they last longer.”

Last longer? That’s an untested assumption at best, and based on the limited experience thus far it is dubious.

Notice Giuletti didn’t say the buses are safer. On January 23, just one day after Lamont’s green virtue signaling event, one of the state’s “pilot program” fleet of 12 electric buses burst into flames while sitting unused in a parking lot in Hamden, Connecticut. The bus was out of service at the time, sitting idle, minding its own business, you might say, when it spontaneously combusted. Because of the particular chemistry of the lithium-ion batteries that power the EV buses, the fire department had to let the inferno burn out on its own.

“Lithium ion battery fires are difficult to extinguish due to the thermal chemical process that produces great heat and continually reignites,” Hamden fire officials said, according to the Manhattan Contrarian.

State officials, who had been praising the EV bus transition only the day before, immediately pulled Connecticut’s remaining EV bus fleet from service. In this instance, they put public safety above green virtue-signaling. The New Haven Register quoted state transit spokesman Josh Rickman as saying, “The importance of rider safety is demonstrated by taking these buses out of service and ensuring an investigation is completed prior to any redeployment of the fleet.”

The state’s 12 EV buses, the shining example of an explosive future, were replaced with good, old, reliable, less-expensive diesel buses that were pulled out of mothballs and put back into service.

If all of Connecticut’s emissions from all sources went away tomorrow, it would have no measureable impact on climate change. None. Zero. Connecticut’s officials should never have been playing Russian roulette with the state’s school children and public transit riders. Yet that’s just what they did.

As I detailed in previous Climate Change Weekly posts (here, here, and here, for example), EV cars, buses, and scooters in the United States and around the world have long been known to endanger the public by spontaneously combusting or by stranding emergency personnel during emergency calls when their batteries run down. For a government to put its citizens or residents at risk to score green brownie points, even for a moment, is unconscionable.

"Biden Promises, Policies and Political Problems",Paul Driessen,"Presidential candidate Joe Biden promised to reunite America following its “season of darkness” under President Trump, and “shut down the virus, not the economy.” We’ve seen how that’s working out.

His promise that there’ll be “no more drilling, no more pipelines, no more fossil fuels” has been far more successful. Within hours of taking office, President Biden ended Keystone XL pipeline construction and began imposing leasing and drilling moratoriums, slow-walking permits, pressuring banks not to fund oil companies, and taking other steps to turn his promises into policies.

Unfortunately, with a little assistance from Putin’s savagery in Ukraine, Mr. Biden’s war on fossil fuels brought a host of political problems.

Gasoline and diesel prices more than doubled since November 2020; they reached $9.50 per gallon in parts of California before falling slightly. Mr. Biden’s approval plummeted, as food prices and inflation soared, and farmers, families, commuters and truckers voiced outrage.

But because allowing more drilling would anger climate cultists obsessed with the catechism of climate cataclysm, Mr. Biden asked Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran to increase their oil production, so that he could keep America’s resources locked up.

He also released 125,000,000 barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve’s emergency stockpiles – and on July 26 said he’d release 20,000,000 additional barrels. The administration claims this will “help lower energy costs,” “reduce the pain Americans are feeling at the pump,” and combat the “Putin price hike.” Perhaps minimally.

Worse, Team Biden sent some 5,000,000 barrels of this oil overseas. Still more incredibly, it sold 950,000 barrels to the China Petrochemical Corporation. That’s China as in Chinese Communist Party – not Taiwan. The same Chinese government that is buying up thousands of acres of U.S. land, much of it near sensitive military installations.

The optics are not good. And for an administration (and Democrat Party) focused on “racial justice” and America’s terrible legacy of slavery, public perceptions will only get worse, as the realities of the “green energy transition” become clear.

First, this energy is not clean, green, renewable or sustainable. The sheer numbers of wind turbines, solar panels, and vehicle and backup batteries defy imagination.

President Biden intends to eradicate coal and natural gas for generating electricity, gasoline and diesel for powering vehicles, natural gas for smelting and manufacturing, and natural gas for heating, cooking and water heating in homes, hospitals, schools and businesses.

This would send America’s annual electricity requirement to almost 7.5 billion megawatt-hours per year by 2050. That’s nearly three times the fossil fuel portion of today’s U.S. electricity generation. It would require tens of thousands of wind turbines, billions of solar panels, and billions of half-ton battery modules (to back up this expensive, unreliable, unpredictable, weather-dependent energy) sprawling across America. (Of course we’d need less electricity if they just slashed our living standards.)

Oil and natural gas are also feed stocks for paints, plastics, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers and numerous other products. How does Team Biden plan to replace them?

President Biden’s proposal for 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind power alone would require 2,500 enormous 800-foot-tall 12-megawatt turbines. Even if they operated at full capacity 24/7, they wouldn’t meet peak summertime electricity needs for New York State, much less the entire USA.

But the turbines would require millions of tons of raw materials from hundreds of new mines – steel, aluminum, copper, fiberglass, concrete and others, whose extraction, processing and refining are energy- and land-intensive and highly polluting.

Billions of solar panels would require massive amounts of polysilicon and other materials, from hundreds more mines. Billions of battery modules would require prodigious quantities of cobalt, nickel, lithium, rare earth elements, copper and other metals. More transformers and transmission lines – still more materials, from still more mines.

Second, American environmentalists and climate campaigners steadfastly oppose these activities anywhere in the USA. The supply chains for most of these materials thus run through China – which controls the mining (in Mongolia, Africa, South America and elsewhere), processing (in China and Mongolia) and manufacturing (in China).

China and the Chinese Communist Party achieve this because they have acquired mining properties all over the world; have huge coal-fired power plants to generate cheap electricity; don’t bother much with air or water pollution control, mined land reclamation or workplace safety standards required in Western countries; and utilize dirt-cheap, slave and child labor, most notably in Africa and Uyghur territories.

Some 40,000 children already labor with their parents in Democratic Republic of Congo cobalt mines, for a few dollars a day, under threats of cave-ins, and with constant exposure to toxic air, mud, dust and water – just to meet today’s cobalt needs for manufacturing batteries. Those needs would skyrocket under a U.S. Green New Deal, and vastly more under an international “energy transition.”

The cobalt ore is processed in China, under equally abominable safety and pollution conditions. Air and water pollution and an enormous toxic waste dump for rare earth effluents in Inner Mongolia have created serious health issues for plant workers and local residents.

China also uses Uyghur slave labor to manufacture solar panels it sells to the United States. And Mr. Biden wants to suspend tariffs on Chinese solar panels, to make importing them even easier and cheaper.

Over the past decade, the United States significantly reduced its (plant-fertilizing) carbon dioxide emissions, largely by replacing coal-fired electricity generation with natural gas.

Meanwhile, in 2020 alone, China put 38,000 megawatts of new coal-fired power plants into operation. It relies on coal for 60% of its electricity and expects to mine 300 million more tons of coal in 2022 than in 2021. Beijing is also building, planning or financing more than 300 coal plants in Turkey, Vietnam, Indonesia, African countries and elsewhere, to raise their people out of poverty. India too burns millions of tons of coal annually.

The United States could go fossil-fuel-free, and it wouldn’t affect global greenhouse gas levels one iota.

But America could easily go from being a net oil and gas exporter two years ago, to being almost totally dependent on often unfriendly foreign sources for the materials required for its “renewable” energy, economy, manufacturing, living standards, communication, transportation – and national defense. Energy, food and consumer prices would climb even higher, hammering minority and other poor families.

Moreover, every increase in “green” energy makes the United States more reliant on China which, like Russia, increasingly wields its energy, mineral and economic power as a weapon, to keep its client countries in line, dependent and subservient. Every increase makes us more complicit in slavery, eco-colonialism, environmental degradation and climate injustice.

This Land of the Free must change course. As America reflects on its past, seeks “a more perfect Union,” reassesses the Separation of Powers, and endeavors to be a world leader in environmental protection and human rights, it must chart a future based on reality and true justice for all people.","August 4, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/biden-promises-policies-and-political-problems/
"U.S. Surface Station Network Is Fatally Flawed, Heartland Report Shows",H. Sterling Burnett,"Way back when climate change was still called global warming, the whole thing was a bit more honest. The basic underlying cause of how catastrophic climate change is supposed to be occurring is greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere, trapping heat, warming the Earth, and driving myriad other changes such as worsening weather events.

The problem for that narrative is that the Earth has not been warming to the degree (pun fully intended) that climate models have consistently projected over the years it would. No catastrophic warming, no catastrophic climate change. If climate models are wrong about the most basic projection they were created to make, there is no reason to take any of their other projections seriously.

Worse news for climate alarmists—though not for normal people with other things to worry about—is that even the warming that has been recorded is a result of bias, not reality, with reported average temperatures being higher and trending steeper than if the system used accurate measurements. Proof of this has been published in a new report by The Heartland Institute: Corrupted Climate Stations: The Official U.S. Surface Temperature Record Remains Fatally Flawed. This report is an update of a 2009 study by meteorologist Anthony Watts, a Heartland senior fellow: Is The U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable? Spoiler alert: it wasn’t then, and it isn’t now.

The 2009 study found approximately 89 percent of the stations used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to calculate average U.S. temperatures failed to meet the National Weather Service’s (NWS) siting standards, which stipulate stations must be 30 meters (100 feet) or more away from any artificial or radiating reflecting heat source. That was disgracefully poor performance. The new, updated report says the situation is now worse.

The 2009 report received widespread media attention, which sparked multiple agency audits and Inspector General investigations. Several scientific studies confirmed Watts’ results, all the while trying to downplay their importance. As one Inspector General report stated, “NOAA acknowledges that there are problems with the [United States Historical Climatology Network] data due to biases introduced by such means as undocumented site relocation, poor siting, or instrument changes.”

NOAA and the NWS took a variety of actions in the aftermath of the 2009 report, perhaps in response to it. Some were positive; others appear intended to bolster the claims of dangerously rising temperatures on which Watts’s study cast doubt.

On the positive side, the agencies closed some of the worst temperature stations, in particular those held out for specific ridicule in Watts’ 2009 report. These include stations in Marysville, California; at the University of Arizona; in Tucson; in Ardmore and Perry, Oklahoma; and in Lampasas, Texas. These stations were in or beside parking lots, highways, or buildings and/or adjacent to air conditioning units and barbecue pits. Unfortunately, as the new survey of stations found, other stations, although similarly badly located but not highlighted for specific attention in the initial report, remained open. Their biased temperature measurements are still distorting the official record.

NOAA also rolled out a new network of temperature stations: the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN). Although the USCRN was in the works while Watts was compiling his data, the final rollout of 114 stations wasn’t completed until 2012. It comprises a subset of existing temperature gauge locations that meet all NWS conditions for unbiased, high-quality temperature data that are not expected to be affected by nearby development or the placement of artificial heat sources for at least the next 50 years. The National Climate Data Center described the USCRN thus:

The USCRN measures temperature with superior accuracy and continuity in places that land-use change will not likely impact during the next five decades. Built specifically for this purpose … [t]he USCRN serves, as its name and original intent imply, as a reference network for operational estimates of national-scale temperature.

Concurrent with the creation of the USCRN, NOAA developed a second new temperature recording and reporting network, adding thousands of stations from the Global Historical Climatology Network to NOAA’s Historical Climate Network of 1,218 stations for a new dataset it called “nClimGrid.” This new system collects data from more than 10,000 high-quality (unbiased) and low-quality (biased) stations alike.

Would it surprise any of CCW’s regular readers to learn that in its monthly and annual reports on temperature and weather trends, NOAA does not use or cite the data from the unbiased USCRN? Instead, the federal government’s official reports cite data from the woefully inadequate, fatally compromised nClimGrid network. Why would that be, one wonders, since NOAA acknowledges the USCRN has, in its own words, “superior accuracy”? Could it be because the USCRN dataset shows warming of less than half that recorded by the broader, biased system? The USCRN shows an unalarming amount of warming, which doesn’t make for compelling reports motivating large-scale government action and increased funding and personnel for the agencies.

For the new report, Watts and his team of volunteers surveyed a representative sample of the original temperature gauges and the more recent nClimGrid network, in different regions across the country. The results were worse than even I could have imagined. As the media advisory on the report states, “96% of U.S. Climate Data Is Corrupted.” You read that right. Instead of improving station siting and reporting since the 2009 report, the temperature dataset NOAA uses for official reports has gotten worse.

This survey confirms what independent studies have also found, as Watts noted in his statement: “The issue of localized heat-bias with these stations has been proven in a real-world experiment conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and published in a peer reviewed science journal.”

I suggest you read Watts’s shocking report in full before the corporate media coverage biases everyone’s view of the study by twisting or downplaying the importance of its findings and critique. For me the main takeaway is threefold. First, the government is either inept or stubbornly refusing to learn from its mistakes for political reasons, with possibly both at play. Second, the government’s official temperature record can’t be trusted. It reflects a clear urban heat-bias effect, not national temperature trends. Third, you can’t trust the official temperature record, and with rising temperatures supposedly driving dangerous climate change, you shouldn’t trust the government’s projections of worsening extreme weather events.

It’s just not getting as hot as fast as climate alarmists within and outside the government are telling us.

DUTCH FARMERS’ CLIMATE POLICY PROTEST SPREADING … ELECTRIC-POWERED POLICE CARS LEAVING EMERGENCIES UNTENDED

DUTCH FARMERS’ CLIMATE POLICY PROTEST SPREADING

News outlets around the world have been reporting on the weeks-long protests by farmers in the Netherlands against the government’s climate policies, which it acknowledges may put 30 percent of the country’s farmers out of business. This is one of the worst possible times for the nation’s parliament to spring this proposal. Famine in parts of Africa, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and high energy prices and supply chain problems hampering fertilizer availability have sharply curtailed crop production and transport.

The Netherlands is the European Union’s (EU) second-largest exporter of agricultural products. To comply with EU climate diktats, the Dutch parliament proposes limiting the use of nitrogen fertilizer by as much as 95 percent in some regions of the country and removing a large portion of the nation’s cattle herds, to reduce emissions. The government admits these policies will put some farmers out of business.

“If successfully implemented, the state initiative to ‘go green’ would almost certainly cripple the country’s private agricultural industry, as the regulations are ‘expected to include reducing livestock and buying up some farms whose animals produce large amounts of ammonia,'” The Federalist reports. “‘The honest message … is that not all farmers can continue their business,’ the government admitted in a statement last month.”

In response, Dutch farmers began widespread protests, which have lasted more than three weeks now. Among the actions farmers have taken to protest the climate proposals are bringing hundreds of cows to Parliament and threatening to slaughter them; spraying manure on parliament buildings; protesting outside government ministers’ homes and dumping manure there; parking more than 40,000 tractors and work trucks on the nation’s highways, bringing traffic to a standstill; and most recently, as The Federalist reports, “dozens of farmers in trucks and tractors parked outside major supermarket distribution centers in cities throughout the country.”

In a show of solidarity with the farmers, Dutch commercial fishermen joined the protests and have begun using their ships to block ports throughout the country. This has resulted in ferries and other ships being delayed by hours.

The government’s initial response was to issue citations and fines to hundreds of farmers for blocking roads. Now the government has turned violent, with police in some cities firing tear gas and using dogs to break up protests. In at least one instance, police fired live rounds above and at farmers driving tractors.

Will this become a common occurrence across Europe as more EU countries impose increasingly draconian restrictions on their industries and people to comply with the climate demands of unelected EU bureaucrats? Who knows? This does remind me of the yellow vest protests in France, which began in 2018 only to die down with the onset of COVID restrictions in 2020. The protests were initially sparked by hikes in fuel taxes and new energy fees imposed to force people to drive less and buy new appliances for their homes in order to fight climate change. The protests eventually broadened to cover a wider range of policy issues. The protestors hampered transit and business for months.

Initially the government vowed to move forward with its policies. Ultimately, it bowed to the protestors’ demands and rescinded them—after a lot of unnecessary anguish and government violence.

ELECTRIC-POWERED POLICE CARS LEAVING EMERGENCIES UNTENDED

As rural police departments in the United Kingdom replace vehicles powered by internal combustion engines with electric police cars, “officers [are] struggling to reach crime scenes when they ‘run out of puff,’ according to one police chief,” The Daily Mail reports.

Gloucestershire’s police force has the largest percentage of electric vehicles in its fleet. This has become a problem, Gloucestershire Police and Crime Commissioner Chris Nelson told The Daily Mail. On multiple occasions, police officers have been unable to reach emergencies in a timely fashion because their vehicles ran out of power, Nelson said.

When asked at a public hearing by County Councillor Steve Robinson whether electric vehicles should compose a larger part of the fleet, Nelson responded, “We’ve all got to go towards electric vehicles moving forwards.”

“The design options available for electric vehicles for operational uses are not perhaps as advanced as I would like them to be,” Nelson admitted. “So, let’s put it like this: I’m cautious about going any further down that road at this stage.”

Nelson put the blame not on the inherent limits of the vehicles but on a scarcity of rural charging stations. The author of the Daily Mail article had a harsher assessment, writing,

To point the finger at a lack of charging points misses the point: are his officers expected to spend an hour charging up, even when they have found one, while an emergency is going on down the road? Given the size of the police cars we are typically talking about, limited range will be an issue on most days. Batteries will need recharging after just two or three hours of driving, which I would guess would be a typical day for rural police.

PRESS RELEASE: 96% of U.S. Climate Data Is Corrupted,"Anthony Watts, H. Sterling Burnett","Official NOAA temperature stations produce corrupted data due to purposeful placement in man-made hot spots

Nationwide study follows up widespread corruption and heat biases found at NOAA stations in 2009, and the heat-bias distortion problem is even worse now

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (July 27, 2022) – A new study, Corrupted Climate Stations: The Official U.S. Surface Temperature Record Remains Fatally Flawed, finds approximately 96 percent of U.S. temperature stations used to measure climate change fail to meet what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) considers to be “acceptable” and uncorrupted placement by its own published standards.

The report, published by The Heartland Institute, was compiled via satellite and in-person survey visits to NOAA weather stations that contribute to the “official” land temperature data in the United States. The research shows that 96% of these stations are corrupted by localized effects of urbanization – producing heat-bias because of their close proximity to asphalt, machinery, and other heat-producing, heat-trapping, or heat-accentuating objects. Placing temperature stations in such locations violates NOAA’s own published standards (see section 3.1 at this link), and strongly undermines the legitimacy and the magnitude of the official consensus on long-term climate warming trends in the United States.

“With a 96 percent warm-bias in U.S. temperature measurements, it is impossible to use any statistical methods to derive an accurate climate trend for the U.S.” said Heartland Institute Senior Fellow Anthony Watts, the director of the study. “Data from the stations that have not been corrupted by faulty placement show a rate of warming in the United States reduced by almost half compared to all stations.”

NOAA’s “Requirements and Standards for [National Weather Service] Climate Observations” instructs that temperature data instruments must be “over level terrain (earth or sod) typical of the area around the station and at least 100 feet from any extensive concrete or paved surface.” And that “all attempts will be made to avoid areas where rough terrain or air drainage are proven to result in non-representative temperature data.” This new report shows that instruction is regularly violated.

For more information, or to speak with the authors of this study please contact Vice President and Director of Communications Jim Lakely at [email protected] or call/text 312-731-9364.

This new report is a follow up to a March 2009 study, titled “Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable?” which highlighted a subset of over 1,000 surveyed stations and found 89 percent of stations had heat-bias issues. In April and May 2022, The Heartland Institute’s team of researchers visited many of the same temperature stations as in 2009, plus many not visited before. The new survey sampled 128 NOAA stations, and found the problem of heat-bias has only gotten worse.

“The original 2009 surface stations project demonstrated conclusively that the federal government’s surface temperature monitoring system was broken, with the vast majority of stations not meeting NOAA’s own standards for trustworthiness and quality. Investigations by government watchdogs OIG and GAO confirmed the 2009 report findings,” said H. Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environment Policy at The Heartland Institute who surveyed NOAA surface stations himself this spring. “This new study is evidence of two things. First, the government is either inept or stubbornly refuses to learn from its mistakes for political reasons. Second, the government’s official temperature record can’t be trusted. It reflects a clear urban heat bias effect, not national temperature trends.”

An example of the bias problem

The chart below, found on page 17 of the report, shows 30 years of data from NOAA temperature stations in the Continental United States (CONUS). The blue lines show recorded temperatures and the trend from stations that comply with NOAA’s published standards. The yellow lines are temperatures taken from stations that are not compliant with those standards (i.e. near artificial hot spots). The red lines are the “official” adjusted temperature released by NOAA.

“If you look at the unperturbed stations that adhere to NOAA’s published standard – ones that are correctly located and free of localized urban heat biases – they display about half the rate of warming compared to perturbed stations that have such biases,” Watts said. “Yet, NOAA continues to use the data from their warm-biased century-old surface temperature networks to produce monthly and yearly reports to the U.S. public on the state of the climate.”

“The issue of localized heat-bias with these stations has been proven in a real-world experiment conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory and published in a peer reviewed science journal.” Watts added.

“By contrast, NOAA operates a state-of-the-art surface temperature network called the U.S. Climate Reference Network,” Watts said. “It is free of localized heat biases by design, but the data it produces is never mentioned in monthly or yearly climate reports published by NOAA for public consumption.

The Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank founded in 1984, is one of the world’s leading organizations promoting the work of scientists who are skeptical that human activity is causing a climate crisis.

Heartland has hosted 14 International Conferences on Climate Change attended by thousands since 2008, published the six-volume Climate Change Reconsidered series by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, and for 21 years has published Environment and Climate News. The Heartland Institute has also published several popular books on the climate, including Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming (2015), Seven Theories of Climate Change (2010), and Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable?

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (July 27, 2022) – A new study, Corrupted Climate Stations: The Official U.S. Surface Temperature Record Remains Fatally Flawed, finds approximately 96 percent of U.S. temperature stations used to measure climate change fail to meet what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) considers to be “acceptable” and uncorrupted placement by its own published standards.

The report, published by The Heartland Institute, was compiled via satellite and in-person survey visits to NOAA weather stations that contribute to the “official” land temperature data in the United States. The research shows that 96% of these stations are corrupted by localized effects of urbanization – producing heat-bias because of their close proximity to asphalt, machinery, and other heat-producing, heat-trapping, or heat-accentuating objects. Placing temperature stations in such locations violates NOAA’s own published standards (see section 3.1 at this link), and strongly undermines the legitimacy and the magnitude of the official consensus on long-term climate warming trends in the United States.

“With a 96 percent warm-bias in U.S. temperature measurements, it is impossible to use any statistical methods to derive an accurate climate trend for the U.S.” said Heartland Institute Senior Fellow Anthony Watts, the director of the study. “Data from the stations that have not been corrupted by faulty placement show a rate of warming in the United States reduced by almost half compared to all stations.”

NOAA’s “Requirements and Standards for [National Weather Service] Climate Observations” instructs that temperature data instruments must be “over level terrain (earth or sod) typical of the area around the station and at least 100 feet from any extensive concrete or paved surface.” And that “all attempts will be made to avoid areas where rough terrain or air drainage are proven to result in non-representative temperature data.” This new report shows that instruction is regularly violated.

This new report is a follow up to a March 2009 study, titled “Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable?“ which highlighted a subset of over 1,000 surveyed stations and found 89 percent of stations had heat-bias issues. In April and May 2022, The Heartland Institute’s team of researchers visited many of the same temperature stations as in 2009, plus many not visited before. The new survey sampled 128 NOAA stations, and found the problem of heat-bias has only gotten worse.

“The original 2009 surface stations project demonstrated conclusively that the federal government’s surface temperature monitoring system was broken, with the vast majority of stations not meeting NOAA’s own standards for trustworthiness and quality. Investigations by government watchdogs OIG and GAO confirmed the 2009 report findings,” said H. Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environment Policy at The Heartland Institute who surveyed NOAA surface stations himself this spring. “This new study is evidence of two things. First, the government is either inept or stubbornly refuses to learn from its mistakes for political reasons. Second, the government’s official temperature record can’t be trusted. It reflects a clear urban heat bias effect, not national temperature trends.”

An example of the bias problem

The chart below, found on page 17 of the report, shows 30 years of data from NOAA temperature stations in the Continental United States (CONUS). The blue lines show recorded temperatures and the trend from stations that comply with NOAA’s published standards. The yellow lines are temperatures taken from stations that are not compliant with those standards (i.e. near artificial hot spots). The red lines are the “official” adjusted temperature released by NOAA.

“If you look at the unperturbed stations that adhere to NOAA’s published standard – ones that are correctly located and free of localized urban heat biases – they display about half the rate of warming compared to perturbed stations that have such biases,” Watts said. “Yet, NOAA continues to use the data from their warm-biased century-old surface temperature networks to produce monthly and yearly reports to the U.S. public on the state of the climate.”

“The issue of localized heat-bias with these stations has been proven in a real-world experiment conducted by NOAA’s laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee and published in a peer reviewed science journal.” Watts added.

“By contrast, NOAA operates a state-of-the-art surface temperature network called the U.S. Climate Reference Network,” Watts said. “It is free of localized heat biases by design, but the data it produces is never mentioned in monthly or yearly climate reports published by NOAA for public consumption.

The Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank founded in 1984, is one of the world’s leading organizations promoting the work of scientists who are skeptical that human activity is causing a climate crisis.

Heartland has hosted 14 International Conferences on Climate Change attended by thousands since 2008, published the six-volume Climate Change Reconsidered series by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, and for 21 years has published Environment and Climate News. The Heartland Institute has also published several popular books on the climate, including Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming (2015), Seven Theories of Climate Change (2010), and Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable? (2009).

Banning Modern Agriculture and High Crop Yields?,Paul Driessen,"In just seven decades, America’s conventional (non-organic) farmers increased per-acre corn yields by an incredible 500% – while using steadily less water, fuel, fertilizer and pesticides – feeding millions more people. Among the many reasons for this miracle is their ability to control weeds that would otherwise steal moisture and nutrients from this vital food, animal feed and fuel (ethanol) crop.

Long-lasting herbicides don’t just control weeds. They also promote no-till farming, which helps farmers save costly tractor fuel and avoid breaking up soils – thereby reducing erosion, retaining soil moisture, safeguarding soil organisms, and locking carbon dioxide in the soil (reducing risks of “dangerous manmade climate change,” some say).

In the United States, the second most widely used herbicide after glyphosate (Roundup) is atrazine, which is critical to controlling invasive and hard-to-kill weeds impervious to other herbicides. Atrazine is used on 65 million acres of corn, sorghum and sugarcane. That’s equivalent to Colorado or Oregon, on croplands scattered across a dozen Midwestern states. It’s also used on millions of acres of golf courses, lawns and highway medians nationwide.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has periodically reviewed atrazine science – which now comprises more than 7,000 studies over the past 60 years. It has found the herbicide is safe for people, animals and the environment.

But that hasn’t stopped the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), Pesticide Action Network (PAN) and other groups from campaigning to have atrazine banned outright or regulated into oblivion.

Extreme environmentalists also oppose fossil fuels, genetically engineered crops, and manmade fertilizers and insecticides. But they are silent about dangerous “natural” organic pesticides, including many that are lethal to bees and fish – and about cadmium and other toxic metals that can leach out of solar panels dumped in landfills – even though all these toxic chemicals could end up in our waterways.

Last year, I explained how activists successfully used collusive sue-and-settle lawsuits to force EPA to develop a formal process for evaluating whether endangered species were “likely” to be “adversely affected” by exposure to common pesticides. Facing court-ordered deadlines for completing the new assessments, the agency unsurprisingly found that the vast majority of species would “likely be adversely affected” by herbicides and other pesticides.

But it did so by employing the standard that even one affected plant or animal of a species would trigger prohibitions on using the chemicals. EPA also utilized hopelessly deficient satellite imagery, statewide crop and atrazine data, toxicity studies of unrelated laboratory animals, computer models, and best guesses. The garbage-in/garbage-out exercise bears little relation to real-world use, exposure or risks.

CBD, PAN and other anti-pesticide groups recently sued EPA again, in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. EPA used the lawsuit to justify asking the court to order the agency to “reconsider” a 2019 regulation. So now EPA has proposed that detectable levels of atrazine in US aquatic ecosystems must not exceed the astonishingly low average level of 3.4 parts per billion (ppb) over a 60-day period.

EPA calls this the “concentration equivalent level of concern,” or CE-LOC. But 3.4 ppb is equivalent to 3.4 seconds in 11,500 days – nearly 32 years! Atrazine isn’t plutonium. It’s been used and studied since 1958. To suggest that 3.4 ppb could devastate American ponds and rivers defies reason, and science.

These outfits aren’t even dealing with actual field or pond observations and evidence of harm. They’re talking about extrapolations, backed up mainly by secretive models, conjectures and activist pressure. However, the effects on American agriculture are likely to be profound, and widespread.

This focus on protecting aquatic life goes back two decades or more; it is so “inside baseball” in its details and complexity that eyes roll and readers fall asleep. The essence is this. Barely three years ago, EPA set the atrazine CE-LOC at 15 ppb, based on a host of government, academic, industry and activist studies and comments. Even the US Geological Survey and Agriculture Department weighed in. Prior to that, it was the still-reasonable level of 10 ppb.

In 2016, EPA proposed but ultimately rejected the 3.4 ppb LOC, after numerous farmers and scientific groups pointed out the shoddy methods and poor science the agency used to get there. But this June 30 – employing the court order that the agency itself asked for – EPA “re-evaluated” its decision. The agency dishonestly claimed it had intended all along to set that extremely low standard, and presented its decision for public comment, almost as a fait accompli.

Anticipating the uproar its proposal would cause, EPA said it would seek “external peer review” of its aquatic species risk assessment and 3.4 ppb decision. But this is a far cry from having a formal, balanced Scientific Advisory Panel do a full, impartial, scientific review, under standards actually set by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).

This 3.4 ppb LOC will result in major restrictions on atrazine use and/or necessitate extensive, expensive measures by farmers to control runoff – all based on estimated, predicted, computer-generated atrazine levels across multi-county or multi-state watersheds in which atrazine-based herbicides are used on acreage in who-knows-what proximity to those watersheds.

The near-zero LOC amounts to an effective ban on using atrazine-based herbicides – amid growing international grain shortages, widening hunger, soaring fuel and fertilizer prices, increasing mandates to turn more corn into ethanol (to replace “non-renewable” gasoline), and other important considerations.

This Biden EPA decision certainly looks like a “major federal action,” representing a “transformative expansion” in EPA’s regulatory authority, and raising “major questions” about what specific language in FIFRA gives EPA such enormous, unprecedented authority. It would certainly seem that this 3.4 ppb edict defies the legal standards just recently articulated by the US Supreme Court in West Virginia v. EPA, regarding the agency’s asserted authority to regulate power plants in the name of climate change – wherein the court used precisely those quoted terms to reject EPA’s arrogation of authority.

EPA’s proposed standard would certainly result in significant regional and national political, economic and agricultural consequences. It would certainly affect a significant segment of the US economy – and intrude into arenas that are the province of the US Departments of Agriculture and Energy. It would also undermine EPA’s own climate change mitigation and prevention initiatives.

America’s premier environmental agency seems to be telling the Supreme Court, try and stop us again.

Biden Administration policies have already made energy insanely expensive (up to $5 a gallon for regular and $9 in some California cities), created supply chain crises for baby formula and other essential consumer goods, and sent inflation soaring to 9.1% annualized, compared to 1.5% in January 2021. These policies are battering millions of American families.

The President just returned from Saudi Arabia, where he begged the king and prince to produce more oil, so that Team Biden can continue restricting production of America’s own vast petroleum resources. This is embarrassing, demeaning, hypocritical and destructive.

Amid widespread hunger in Sri Lanka, and even in Germany and the UK, due to extreme green policies, Team Biden seems to think it should cause still more damage – and must kowtow more to extremists.

As the nation flirts with the possibility of recession, would Team Biden really risk another Depression Era Dust Bowl – which occurred in part because of too much plowing, amid still-record high temperatures and droughts decades before anyone conceived of manmade, fossil-fuel-driven climate crises?

This 3.4 ppb LOC is bad science, bad policy, bad agriculture, bad economics, and perverse morality. Anyone wishing to weigh in on the proposal can submit comments until September 6 at:

Threat to Endangered Whales Gets LOUDER,David Wojick,"The Virginia wind-versus-whales story has taken a turn for the worse. Worse for the severely endangered Right Whales that is. My research has found what may be some really bad news.

Meet Tethys. Not the real Tethys, the mythical Greek titaness of the sea, but DOE’s center for reporting research on the environmental impact of energy technology on sea life, including whales. This is the science side of DOE (where I used to work), not the Ocean Energy development side.

Tethys has some profoundly disturbing things to say about offshore wind and really loud underwater noise. Noise that could easily adversely affect the North Atlantic Right Whales.

It is all about pile driving, or in this case tower driving. The hundreds of huge offshore wind towers proposed for Virginia do not have poured concrete foundations like onshore towers do. Instead they are literally driven into the solid seabed by floating pile drivers. The lower part of the tower is designed to be driven.

In fact these driven-in tower bottoms are called “monopiles”. Here is what Tethys says about them:

“The environmental concerns associated with offshore wind farms vary with foundation type. Monopiles, for example, require pile-driving, which produces INCREDIBLY LOUD NOISES that tend to propagate far in the water, even after mitigation strategies such as bubble shields, slow start, and acoustic cladding are employed.” (Emphasis added)

From “Fixed offshore wind” at https://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology/fixed-offshore-wind

Note that not only are the wind tower pile driving noises INCREDIBLY LOUD, the available mitigation technologies do not change that fact.

As a sometime civil engineer, who has worked with much smaller onshore pile driving, I can attest that it is VERY LOUD. It ranges from deafening to damaging if proper headgear is not worn. The Whales will have no such protective gear.

Importantly, Tethys says this about mitigation:

“Measures to reduce noise impacts in the marine environment include the use of bubble curtains during pile driving and careful siting and timing of construction activities to avoid species’ critical migration routes and times.”

From “Noise” at https://tethys.pnnl.gov/stressor/noise

So a standard mitigation measure is to time construction to avoid adversely impacting migration. In short do not drive monopiles during migration. This is exactly what Virginia should do to protect the severely endangered Right Whales. It certainly should be included in the upcoming Environmental Impact Assessment as a mitigation measure.

What no-driving mitigation might cost depends on how much time the 400 or so migrating whales spend in offshore Virginia waters. That it is a relatively long time may be why BOEM has not released their data. See my https://www.cfact.org/2022/07/22/are-the-feds-hiding-the-virginia-endangered-whales/.

Tethys makes it clear that noise from offshore wind is a very serious matter, saying this:

“Sound propagates farther and faster in water than in air, which can result in greater consequences for the marine environment. Coupled with the many other sources of anthropogenic noise in the marine environment (e.g., ships, seismic studies), the noise from offshore wind and marine renewable energy devices may impact many marine species. Noise may interfere with marine organisms’ communication, navigation, detection of prey, and ability to interact with their environment, as well as causing attraction to or avoidance of devices. Additionally, some marine organisms may be physically harmed from excessive noise exposure (e.g., tissue and nerve damage).”

Noise is bad and driving the towers into the sea floor is by far the worst of that bad thing.

This will also be true for the other monster offshore wind arrays planned along the Mid-Atlantic migration route of the severely endangered North Atlantic Right Whales.

The issue is Wind versus Whales. Save the Whales. We do not need the offshore wind power.

For background see my first article here: https://www.cfact.org/2022/07/13/virginias-offshore-wind-proposal-threatens-endangered-whales/.

"Before We Rid the World of Crude Oil, Is There a Backup Replacement?","Ronald Stein, P.E.","Clean Energy is only Clean ELECTRICITY.

Those clean renewables, like wind turbines and solar panels, can only generate ELECTRICITY, and intermittent electricity at best from available breezes and sunshine. The undisputable science is that renewables CANNOT manufacture any of the oil derivatives that are the basis of the thousands of products that are the foundation of societies and economies around the world.

In fact, these renewables cannot exist without crude oil as all the parts of wind turbines and solar panels are made with oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

Crude oil is useless unless it can be manufactured into something usable like the fuels for the heavy-weight and long-range transportation infrastructures of ships and jets and the derivatives that make the thousands of products that have made our lives more comfortable. But wind and solar cannot manufacture anything for society. Before we jump out of an airplane without a tested parachute, we need to be able to support the demands of all the infrastructures that exist today that did not exist a few hundred years ago.

The U.S. Supreme Court on June 30, 2022, dealt a major blow to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) power to regulate carbon emissions.

The Supreme Court just confirmed that the EPA cannot pick winners and losers to meet the electricity and products demanded by society. Clean Energy is only Clean ELECTRICITY.

Those clean renewables, like wind turbines and solar panels, can only generate ELECTRICITY, and intermittent electricity at best from available breezes and sunshine. The undisputable science is that renewables CANNOT manufacture any of the oil derivatives that are the basis of the thousands of products that are the foundation of societies and economies around the world.

Without a backup plan to replace crude oil, ridding the world of crude oil will be depriving citizens of the more than 6,000 products that were non-existent before 1900, made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. Ridding the world of oil, without a replacement in mind is immoral and evil, as extreme shortages will result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths.

The domino effects of tinkering with the supply chain of fossil fuels, is supply shortages and soaring prices for not only electricity, but for the thousands of products that support the entire medical industry, all branches of the military, airports, electronics, communications, merchant ships, container ships, and cruise liners, as well as asphalt for roads, and fertilizers to help feed the world.

The major unintended consequence of divesting in crude oil that was responsible for the world populating from 1 to 8 billion in less than 200 years is that efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change.

Having confidence in humanity’s ability to adapt to climate changes, like they have done since the beginning of time, in my heart of hearts I dream of the day when the public recognizes climate change will not bring on an end of the world as we know it, or even a long-term net decline for human civilization.

However, efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization’s eight billion, and may result in billions, not millions, of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths trying to live without the fossil fuels that have been benefiting society.

Here is a reminder of what wind turbines and solar panels CANNOT manufacture, as these are all manufactured from crude oil. These manufactured items from oil did not exist before 1900. Most importantly, they are needed to support the growing demands of the world’s economy and for the health and well-being of the world’s eight billion residents:

Fuels for the:

50,000 heavy-weight and long-range merchant ships that are moving products throughout the world.

50,000 heavy-weight and long-range jets used by commercial airlines, private usage, and the military.

The 290 million registered vehicles in the U.S. as of 2021, that were comprised of about 56 percent trucks, 40 percent cars, and 4 percent motorcycles.

The cruise ships that now move twenty-five million passengers around the world.

The space program.

Oil derivatives to make thousands of products such as:

Tires for the billions of vehicles.

Asphalt for the millions of miles of roadways.

Medications and medical equipment.



Communications systems, including cell phones, computers, iPhones, and iPads.

Water filtration systems.

Sanitation systems.

Fertilizers that come from natural gas to help feed billions.

Pesticides to control locusts and other pests.

Wind turbines and solar panels as they are all made with products from fossil fuels.

Life Without Oil is NOT AS SIMPLE AS YOU MAY THINK as renewable energy is only intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine and NEITHER wind turbines, nor solar panels, can manufacture direct energy for society. Climate change may impact humanity but being mandated to live without the products manufactured from oil, will necessitate lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s and could be the greatest threat to the planet’s eight billion residents.

Everything that needs electricity, from lights, vehicles, iPhones, defibrillators, computers, telecommunications, etc., are all made with the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. There would be nothing to power in a world without fossil fuels!

Banks and investment giants that are driving today’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels are all the rage on Wall Street to divest in all three fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil. It is appalling that both President Biden and the United Nations support allowing the investment community to collude to reshape economies and our energy infrastructure.

Before divesting in all three fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil, where is the replacement or clone for crude oil, to keep today’s societies and economies running in the healthy and wealthy developed countries?","July 22, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/before-we-rid-the-world-of-crude-oil-is-there-a-backup-replacement/
Oil Exporting and Poorer Countries Have Lower Costs for Gasoline,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The political class obsession in the wealthy countries to lower emissions with subsidizing expensive and utterly unreliable breezes and sunshine to generate electricity, and divesting in fossil fuels, have already put the cost of electrical power and fuel out of the reach of the poorest in the developed first world countries.

The healthy and wealthy countries of the United States of America, Germany, the UK, and Australia representing 6 percent of the world’s population (505 million vs 7.8 billion) could literally shut down, and cease to exist, and the opposite of what you have been told and believe will take place. Emissions will be exploding from those poorer developing countries.

Simply put, in these healthy and wealthy countries, every person, animal, or anything that causes emissions to harmfully rise could vanish off the face of the earth; or even die off, and global emissions will still explode in the coming years and decades ahead over the population and economic growth of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam, and Africa.

Richer countries now have higher gasoline prices, while poorer countries and countries that produce and export oil have lower cost for fuels. A review of global petroleum gasoline prices per gallon in U.S. dollars shows the international intelligence and trends of gasoline prices of the wealthy countries that have opted to go “green” at any cost, compared with poorer countries and countries that produce and export oil.

A sampling of richer countries that have higher prices for gasoline per gallon that have gone “green” and import crude oil to meet the demands of their country:

UK $8.78 per gallon

Germany 27

Australia 48

USA 01

While gasoline nationwide is at or near all-time highs, California gasoline prices tend to be more than a dollar higher than the USA national average due to excessive State taxes and costly environmental compliance programs, which are dumped onto the posted pricing at the pumps.

When we look outside the few wealthy countries, we see that at least 80 percent of humanity, or more than six billion in this world are living on less than $10 a day, and billions living with little to no access to electricity, politicians are pursuing the most expensive ways to generate intermittent electricity. Energy poverty is among the most crippling but least talked-about crises of the 21st century. We should not take energy for granted. Expensive electricity and fuels are being borne by those that can least afford living in “energy poverty.”

A sampling of a few poorer countries and oil exporting countries that have lower prices of gasoline per gallon:

Malaysia $1.76 per gallon

Nigeria 58

Angola 42

Kuwait 30

Algeria 19

Syria 08

Iran 20

Libya 11

Venezuela 08

Before Biden became President, for the first time since Harry Truman was president 70 years ago, we had more crude oil exports than imports. Through the fracking boom in the years before Biden, the U.S. attained crude oil independence status meaning we were no longer held hostage to unstable Petro-powers and the vagaries of foreign energy supplies. Under President Trump, America had an aggressive pro-domestic energy policy, which allowed America to become not only energy independent, which politicians have talked about for decades, but energy dominant.

Rather than expand oil exploration in America to restore America’s oil independence, President Biden is focused on ridding America of fossil fuels, and is off to visit OPEC nations seeking more oil exports to America. The USA was an oil exporter before Biden took office, but under Biden’s direction, this wealthy country now IMPORTS crude oil from unfriendly foreign countries to meet the demands of the American economy.

California, a state that was virtually independent of imported crude oil from foreign countries in 1995, today is the only state in contiguous America that imports oil, now at more than 60 percent of the needs of the fifth largest economy in the world. At today’s price of crude oil well above $100 per barrel the imported crude oil costs California more than $150 million dollars a day, yes, every day, being paid to oil-rich foreign countries, depriving Californians of jobs and business opportunities, and drivers to pay premium prices for fuel.

Biden appears to be self-motivated to clone the direction that California has taken over the last few decades. Rather than significantly increase oil production in America, Biden is following California Governor Newsom’s efforts toward further reductions of in-state oil production and placing greater than the current more than 60 percent dependency on oil rich foreign sources, that also have significantly less environmental control than California. Newsom promotes more costs for Californians and more generated emissions for the world.

The poorer countries that cannot subsidize themselves out of a paper bag, and the countries that produce and export oil, have lower costs for gasoline and may also be less incentivized to seek EV’s for their cost-effective transportation needs.

Shockingly, just to reduce emissions to supposedly stop climate change, President Biden is following the lead of Germany, UK, Australia, and California that now have among the highest costs for electricity and gasoline along inflation being borne by all.

"Remembering Pat Michaels—Science Champion, Climate Realist, A Good Man","H. Sterling Burnett, James Taylor, Jim Lakely, Anthony Watts, Roy Spencer","We at The Heartland Institute are truly surprised and saddened by the passing of Patrick Michaels, Ph.D., this past weekend. We enjoyed a long and productive relationship with Pat. More than that, he was a personal friend to me and many others at the institute. Pat’s death was brought to my attention last Saturday afternoon in a notice from the CO2 Coalition, where he served as a senior fellow. I reprint most of it below:

It is with a heavy heart that we report on the death of dear friend and colleague Pat Michaels on July 16, 2022 (born February 15, 1950). Patrick Michaels obtained an A.B. in biological science in 1971 and an M.S. in biology in 1975 from the University of Chicago, and in 1979 he obtained his Ph.D. in ecological climatology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His doctoral thesis was titled Atmospheric anomalies and crop yields in North America. Patrick J. Michaels was a past president of the American Association of State Climatologists and was program chair for the Committee on Applied Climatology of the American Meteorological Society. He was a research professor of Environmental Sciences at University of Virginia for 30 years. Michaels was a contributing author and is a reviewer of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. His writing has been published in the major scientific journals, including Climate Research, Climatic Change, Geophysical Research Letters, Journal of Climate, Nature, and Science, as well as in popular serials worldwide. He was the author or editor of nine books on climate and its impact, and he was an author of the climate “paper of the year” awarded by the Association of American Geographers in 2004. He appeared on most of the worldwide major media. Dr. Michaels was Senior Fellow at the CO2 Coalition and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. He remained very active up to his last days. He had just completed his review and comments on the USGCR decadal plan and filed them on Thursday. He met with Coalition staff just the day before his passing to discuss his next venture looking at regional assessments of changing climate/CO2 on the Midwest. He leaves a legacy of sound science and dedication to the scientific process. He will be missed terribly.

Numerous accolades and fond remembrances have come to my attention since Pat’s death was made public, a few of which I share below. From meteorologist Anthony Watts, a Heartland Institute Senior Fellow:

I worked on several projects with Pat, and I was always impressed with his depth of knowledge, quick wit, and character. For example, he often wore green tennis shoes to climate conferences because he said the oddity would engage people in conversations he might not have had otherwise. He once said to me that his only regret was hiring/promoting Michael Mann while he was at the University of Virginia.

Roy Spencer, Ph.D., principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and a policy advisor to The Heartland Institute, had this to say on his Facebook post announcing Pat’s death:

Pat was the one I would always point people to as the most up-to-date “skeptic” in terms of what has been published in the climate community (on both sides of the issue) and its significance. When John Christy’s wife died several years ago, Pat flew down from Virginia to Alabama to attend the memorial service.

Pat’s colleagues at CEI had this to say:

The Competitive Enterprise Institute and the entire policy community lost a friend and colleague last week. We mourn the death of Dr. Patrick J. Michaels (1950-2022), who joined CEI as a senior fellow in 2019. His contributions had an immediate and lasting effect on the intersection of science and climate policy. His work spanned careers in academia, government, as a private consultant, and in the non-profit sector. … Pat was a straight shooter with a zeal and mastery of the policy details that we all strive to emulate. He was quick to share a mischievous sense of humor. His passing leaves a hole in our hearts and we extend our deepest condolences to his wife Rachel, his family, friends, as well as a global network of colleagues and collaborators. Pat’s good humor and insight will be greatly missed.

Pat was one of the leading lights among researchers in pursuit of the truth about climate change. Pat was also among the best and most engaging communicators about the current state of climate science and why climate doomsaying is not just unwarranted but misleading. Pat’s research and his review of the research of other climate scientists led him to believe that although humans are contributing to the current climate change, it is not a catastrophe or a serious danger to the environment or human civilization. Pat referred to this position as “lukewarming,” and to himself as a “lukewarmer.” After looking at the data, Pat also argued the solutions being proposed by politicians to fight climate change were likely to produce worse outcomes for humanity than any harms that might reasonably be expected to result from climate change itself.

At one time Pat had a fairly regular feature in Environment & Climate News, and he served as an expert reviewer for the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change’s Climate Change Reconsidered series of books.

Pat was a speaker at 11 of The Heartland Institute’s 14 International Conferences on Climate Change, missing only those held overseas. His presentations at these events are all worth watching, and some of them can be viewed (listed most recent to first) here:

ICCC 1, Global Warming: Some Convenient Facts

As indicated in the CO2 Coalition’s note above, Pat received many awards for his climate research. The Heartland Instituted was proud to award Pat the Courage in Defense of Science Award in 2019.

As hard as it is for me to believe, I’ve known and worked with Pat off and on for 26 years. That time seems way too short now.

Although I’ve worked outside of the D.C. area for most of my career, I enjoyed many informative and entertaining conversations with Pat, over drinks and meals and at conferences and meetings. More often our exchanges were in the form of emails back and forth, discussing this or that study or bill. Despite having conducted more than 360 podcasts since I joined Heartland, I was surprised to find I had interviewed Pat only twice, although a keyword search shows he or his work was discussed by other interviewees on a number of occasions. In light of his passing, this seems a gross and unfortunate oversight on my part.

I’m sure much more can and will be said about Dr. Patrick Michaels’ life and work in the coming days and weeks. For now, I’ll close by saying I will miss Pat Michaels—his intellect, his jocularity, his wit, and his knowledge—in both a professional and personal capacity.

My prayers are with his friends and family.

Pat Michaels: Engaging, Unpretentious, Kind, and an Influential Climate Scientist

Pat Michaels is one of a select club of people who can plausibly claim to be the most influential person in the history of the Climate Realism movement. Moreover, Pat was endearingly engaging, unpretentious, and kindhearted.

My initial introduction to Pat Michaels was through his groundbreaking book Sound and Fury: The Science and Politics of Global Warming. As a student at Syracuse University College of Law, I was editor-in-chief of the SU Law Federalist Voice. With all the reports of a global warming crisis, I was motivated to make the case to my fellow conservatives and libertarians that with a planet on fire, we have to check our political and ideological dispositions at the door and do whatever it takes to fend off climate Armageddon. I wanted to go deeper than CNN and USA Today to obtain and present material for my argument. Exercising due diligence, I read Pat’s book. Sound and Fury opened my eyes to the true nature of the global warming issue and the way climate activists and leftists were politicizing it for their own benefit. With Pat’s book as the starting point, I discovered a mountain of scientific evidence casting extreme doubt on the asserted climate crisis.

Approximately 10 years later, soon after joining The Heartland Institute, I was attending a conference in which Pat was a speaker. I nervously introduced myself and told him how he had made such an impact on me. Pat immediately began talking to me like I was lifelong friend, making it a point to treat me as his equal in all respects, which I decidedly wasn’t. Over the years, whenever we would attend the same event, he would always make it a point to find me and begin each conversation, in a playful, semi-conspiratorial tone, with, “Taylor, did you hear the latest about …?” Seeing Pat was always one of the highlights of such events.

Pat’s knowledge of climate science was unsurpassed. Moreover, Pat’s ability to present in-depth scientific information in a compelling, entertaining, and understandable manner set him apart from most others. Whenever Heartland hosted a climate conference, people would ask me—with great anticipation—whether Pat would be delivering one of the keynotes. No matter how many times people watched a Pat Michaels presentation, they always wanted more.

The scientific world suffered a great loss with Pat’s passing. So, too, did the human condition.

James Taylor, President, The Heartland Institute

Pat Michaels: Climate Change Iconoclast, Science Champion

Pat Michaels was one of a kind: brave, smart, and independent—even down to his penchant for wearing loud green sneakers with his suit when attending Heartland’s climate conferences.

Of the many excellent keynote addresses Pat delivered at our conferences, one that has always stuck with me was his exposure of the corruption of academia. No young scientist just starting out at a university could dare look at the climate data and state publicly that something looks fishy. If a scientist wanted to stay long in his academic profession, he had to go along 100 percent with the alarmist narrative. Not only is that the only way to keep grant money flowing, Pat said, it is also essential to getting published in the scientific literature. And if you don’t get published, you don’t get tenure. And even after you achieve tenure, you can’t then question the narrative or you’ll risk a hit on your reputation for undermining what you previously submitted as sound research.

Pat was among the few scientists with the experience and insight to point out just how corrupt the professional climate science industry is. He sacrificed jobs in academia and his position as the state climatologist of Virginia, and he was subjected to relentless personal attacks. But, through it all, Pat never lost his fire for the truth or his sense of humor.

Pat’s death leaves a big void in the world of climate science and in the hearts of all his friends.

Virginia’s Offshore Wind Proposal Threatens Endangered Whales,David Wojick,"The massive offshore wind (OSW) project proposed by Dominion Energy may pose a serious threat to the endangered North Atlantic Right Whale population. A comprehensive environmental impact assessment is required to determine the extent of this threat and the mitigation it might require. The same is true for the other proposed Mid-Atlantic OSW projects.

The North Atlantic Right Whale is reported to be the world’s most endangered large whale, with an estimated population of just a few hundred critters. They winter off of Florida and Georgia, but summer off New England. So they migrate through the coastal waters off of Virginia twice a year, including that year’s baby whales. They can grow to over 50 feet in length and weigh more than 70 tons. Protecting them is a major challenge.

For background see https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/north-atlantic-right-whale.

Phase one of the huge proposed Virginia/Dominion OSW project looks to occupy something like 400 square miles. Pause two might bump that up to 800 or 1,000 square miles and the proposed federal lease area for OSW is even greater, much greater in fact.

The obvious monster question is how will all this development affect the severely endangered Right Whale population? Answering this question must be central to the project’s required Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) under NEPA. This is Federal land.

For example, will the whales enter the resulting maze of giant towers and whirling overhead blades? If not then OSW might well be a significant obstacle to the migration. So we first need to know just how these migrations work, in both directions. Is there a single path or many highly distributed paths? Are they taken by single whales or large groups? Do they quickly go straight through or us there a lot of wandering and feeding?

Then too, there is a great deal of northbound and southbound shipping in this area. The Northeast US and Canada supply, and are supplied by, many places and countries to the South. Being struck by ships is the leading cause of whale death. If the OSW arrays force the whales into the shipping lanes the impact could be devastating. Note that these huge OSW arrays are also an obstacle to commercial shipping, which might tend to concentrate the shipping, thereby increasing the threat of killing whales.

Then there is the noise issue. Whales communicate acoustically and there is an extensive literature on how human noise adversely impacts them. That wind arrays create a lot of noise is well established, with many states having noise limits for onshore wind.

So we need to know things like

How noisy will this Virginia/Dominion array be under water? What are the likely frequencies and how are they related to whale communication? Will the noise make it harder for whales to hear approaching ships? If a problem, how far will it extend?

It is conceivable that the noise might cause confusion, distress or even act like a great wall to the whales trying to migrate. Confusion alone could be dangerous to the baby whales. So the impact of noise should be a central part of the EIA.

There are other potential issues as well. For example, how might the huge OSW array affect the local food supply for the whales? What about the impact of construction, as compared to operation.

In addition to building and operating the huge OSW array itself, there may be issues with the power lines use to bring the juice ashore. These lines are collectively gigantic compared to even our biggest onshore power lines.

Phase one has a generating capacity of about 2,600 MW, with phase two boosting that to 5,200 MW. To my knowledge the biggest AC power line in America is just around 750 MW, and up to 1,000 MW for DC. Thus the OSW lines dwarf these land lines.

The whales are thought to actually dig into the ocean floor, which is an obvious problem with these monster power lines. But there is also the question of how the strong EMF of these lines might affect them?

In some cases, not building or operating during migration might be a viable mitigation action. Depending on how long a period that is, it might significantly change the economics of OSW.

In addition to NEPA, these whales are supposedly protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act. I say supposedly because it appears that the proper analyses are not being done. There is already litigation along these lines for a smaller OSW array in New England. See https://www.texaspolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/001-Complaint-without-Exhibits.pdf.

The responsible agency is the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and you can see from the name that they might not want to inhibit ocean energy development on environmental grounds. Their middle name is Ocean Energy.

The lawsuit says that BOEM’s EIS for this New England project is cursory at best. Apparently the other agencies charged with enforcing these whale protection laws were also feeble. Given that the Biden Administration is hell bent on OSW development, this neglect may be predictable.

Likewise, I have heard nothing about whales from Dominion or Virginia. They both love OSW, just as BOEM does.

Litigation in Virginia may be the only real protection the whales have.

Note that in addition to this Virginia case, a whole series of huge OSW arrays are proposed along the East Coast. North Carolina has one just south of Virginia’s, Maryland just a bit north, and so on. These successive arrays add up to a formidable gauntlet that the migrating whales will have to run twice a year. Surely this endangers the whales.

The adverse impact of massive offshore wind development on the highly endangered North Atlantic Right Whale has yet to be properly assessed. It must be done.

Supreme Court Restores Limits on Executive Agencies,H. Sterling Burnett,"During the final weeks of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 term, the Justices issued some truly historic rulings. In doing so, the Court went a long way toward reestablishing itself as a coequal branch of government designed to uphold individual rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution against illegal government restrictions, while defending the separation of powers, laid out in the Constitution, among the branches of the federal government and between the federal government and the states.

The cases decided by the Court included the president’s power to set immigration policy, state and local government s ‘ discrimination against expressions of religious faith, limits on gun rights, and the federal guarantee of access to abortions, among numerous other issues the Court ruled on.

As important as the rulings in this wide range of cases are, the decision in West Virginia v. EPA, setting limits on the administrative state’s powers, is arguably the most consequential and far-reaching from an economic standpoint and in regard to the Constitution’s separation and delegation of powers.

The 6-3 decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts in West Virginia v. EPA denies the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) attempt to use an obscure provision of the 1963 Clean Air Act to usurp states’ longstanding authority to manage their electric power grids, by limiting the allowable generating sources. In its 2015 Clean Power Plan, the EPA tried to force states to close their coal plants, limit use of natural gas, and expand wind and solar generation in order to “decarbonize” America’s power supply.

The Court majority held that the EPA grossly overstepped its statutory authority in regulating carbon dioxide. The U.S. Constitution delegates to Congress alone the power to regulate interstate commerce. Unelected bureaucrats may not usurp that power by addressing major questions, meaning policies that are politically and economically significant, without clear direction from the legislature. Carbon dioxide is ubiquitous, and sharply limiting it by restructuring the nation’s power grid is a major undertaking that would impose trillions of dollars in costs, affect millions of jobs, and disrupt every sector of the economy. Redesigning the nation’s power grid, as the EPA attempted to do by dictating how the states power their economies, is a major policy undertaking, and Congress did not delegate it to the EPA.

“Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal to generate electricity may be a sensible ‘solution to the crisis of the day,'” wrote Chief Justice John Roberts for the majority. “But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme. A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body.”

Not only did the Court’s majority find Congress never explicitly granted the EPA the kind of power it claimed, Congress had taken up proposals to limit carbon dioxide emissions on several occasions and chose not to enact them, Roberts noted.

“At bottom, the Clean Power Plan essentially adopted a cap-and-trade scheme, or set of state cap-and-trade schemes, for carbon,” Roberts wrote. “Congress, however, has consistently rejected proposals to amend the Clean Air Act to create such a program. It has also declined to enact similar measures, such as a carbon tax.”

A concurring opinion authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch expanded on Roberts’ line of reasoning. Congress’s choice not to act on an issue a particular presidential administration may think is important is not a grant to executive agencies undertake action on their own, regardless of how dire the administration or agency may believe the problem to be. Gorsuch writes,

When Congress seems slow to solve problems, it may be only natural that those in the Executive Branch might seek to take matters into their own hands. But the Constitution does not authorize agencies to use pen-and-phone regulations as substitutes for laws passed by the people’s representatives. In our Republic, “[i]t is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society.” Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136 (1810). Because today’s decision helps safeguard that foundational constitutional promise, I am pleased to concur.

“The Supreme Court rightly stayed in its lane in this case, as the Trump Court has increasingly been doing, restoring the separation of powers that is necessary to avert tyranny while leaving policy questions to Congress,” said S. T. Karnick, a senior fellow at The Heartland Institute, in a press release commenting on the ruling. “Ruling narrowly on whether the EPA was operating under authority granted by Congress in declaring carbon dioxide a pollutant, the Court correctly determined that the agency had overstepped its bounds, and that is that.

“Regardless of one’s opinion of the policy the rule was meant to establish, the EPA had no authority to impose it,” said Karnick.

The Court’s ruling in West Virginia v. EPA has implications far beyond the EPA’s desire to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The court’s reasoning also limits the ability of cabinet departments, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT), and agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. If the EPA, which is charged with protecting the environment, can’t restructure the economy to limit greenhouse gas emissions, neither can other departments or agencies for which protecting the environment is at best tangential to their areas of authority. The Court’s ruling should effectively bar the proposed rules at HUD, the DOT, and FERC intended to force public housing developers, infrastructure developers, and utilities to limit greenhouse gases to obtain approval for their projects. And with the Court’s reasoning in mind, the SEC should not be allowed to dictate that every publicly traded company account for and develop plans to address climate change or face government sanctions.

The Court’s ruling goes far beyond the issue of climate change. With this decision, the Court has effectively informed federal agencies that the separation of powers is alive and well, and Congress alone makes law. Going forward, departments and agencies will have to exercise appropriate restraint and humility when regulating, strictly adhering to their mission and the letter of the laws passed by Congress. If executive agencies enact policies that involve major questions, courts will no longer necessarily defer to their judgements about whether a particular rule or policy is justified or sanctioned by Congress.

As Steve Milloy, a member of The Heartland Institute’s board of directors, wrote in an editorial responding to the Court’s ruling in West Virginia V. EPA, there remains a lot of work to do to halt dangerous efforts to end fossil fuel use and restructure the economy to far-left elitists’ liking. But the Supreme Court’s decision is a very good start.

COLD KILLS MORE PEOPLE THAN HEAT, STUDY CONFIRMS … ISLANDS GROWING FASTER THAN SEAS ARE RISING … COAL AND GAS MAKE A COMEBACK IN EUROPE

COLD KILLS MORE PEOPLE THAN HEAT, STUDY CONFIRMS

A new study in The Lancet confirms what previous peer-reviewed studies have found: cold temperatures kill far more people than hot temperatures.

The new study, from 15 researchers at universities, research institutes, and government agencies in China and the United States, examined the incidence of premature mortality attributable to nonoptimal temperatures across all the provinces of China. Between 498,000 and 704,000 deaths were attributable to nonoptimal temperatures in China in 2019, with the best estimate being 593,000 premature deaths, the scientists found. Of the deaths traced to nonoptimal temperatures, 580,000 of were caused by health factors attributed to cold temperatures, and approximately 13,000 were tied to warm temperatures.

This research indicates approximately 46 times more people in China died from cardiovascular and respiratory problems effected by nonoptimal cold temperatures than nonoptimal hot temperatures.

China is the most populous country on Earth, and its results coincide with the findings of two previous large-scale (global), long-term studies previously published in The Lancet (in 2015 and 2021): cold kills more people than heat, and should the Earth continue its modest warming, the number of deaths attributable to nonoptimal temperatures should decline sharply.

The 2021 Lancet study examined premature mortality tied to nonoptimal temperatures across 43 countries accounting for more than five million such deaths annually between 2000 and 2019. Regardless of the country or region—cold, hot, or temperate—cold-related deaths greatly outnumber heat-related deaths, accounting for 10 to 20 times as many fatalities, the scientists found.

ISLANDS GROWING FASTER THAN SEAS ARE RISING

A report published in Human Progress found the claim that rising seas driven by climate change are submerging small island nations is bunk. Analyst Joakim Book writes,

A repeated fear—and political football—in the climate change conversation is the plight of small island nations. When the United Nations’ climate summits roll around, these nations, consisting of islands and atolls barely a few feet above sea level, are, like clockwork, made out to be victims of an ever-encroaching ocean. Because seawater level rises have accelerated in recent decades and low-lying islands are supposedly the most vulnerable, we’d expect at least some of them to have lost land area to the sea.

In reviewing the literature, Book found sea levels are rising by only 3 to 3.6 millimeters per year, not the computer-model-generated runaway rate of 25 millimeters cited in most stories claiming small-island nations are being submerged by rising seas. Even more importantly (and unsurprisingly), Book found most island nations are taking adaptive measures to harden themselves against sea level rise instead of acting helpless and doing nothing about it. “Globally speaking, the world is reclaiming more area from the oceans than the rising tides swallow,” Book writes. Research from far-flung locations in the Netherlands, Vietnam, and island chains in Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Maldives shows these areas are gaining land mass and their populations, infrastructure, and economies are growing despite the (slowly) rising seas.

These research papers have been previously discussed in Climate Realism posts, including here, here, here, and here.

“Despite gradual sea level rise, the most low-lying island nations on the planet are growing—they are adapting to rising sea levels and overcoming the changes that their natural environment presents to them,” Book writes.

COAL AND GAS MAKE A COMEBACK IN EUROPE

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is forcing Europe to reconsider its commitment to ending fossil fuel use. Countries from Denmark to Germany and beyond are reopening coal plants once shuttered to fight climate change and are restarting or advancing plans for domestic natural gas development.

France 24 reports Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands are removing all restrictions on the use of coal to fuel power plants and are reopening shuttered plants to keep their electric power grids from collapsing because of the loss of Russian natural gas upon which each country had become reliant.

“The cabinet has decided to immediately withdraw the restriction on production for coal-fired power stations from 2002 to 2024,” Rob Jetten, the Dutch minister for climate and energy policy, told journalists, France 24 reports.

Before the announcement, the Netherlands had limited fossil fuel plants to providing no more than a third of the electric power generated in the country.

While reaffirming its commitment to phase out coal use by 2030, Germany announced it was restarting previously shuttered coal power plants after Gazprom cut deliveries via the Nord Stream gas pipeline last week.

Green Party representative Robert Habeck, vice chancellor of Germany and federal minister for economic affairs and climate action, told France 24 the government’s decision to revert to coal was ‘bitter, but indispensable for reducing gas consumption.'”

Austria announced it was working with the country’s main electricity supplier to bring a closed coal-fueled power station in the southern city of Mellach back online because of the loss of natural gas from Russia.

In addition to addressing electric power shortfalls tied to the war in Ukraine, some European countries are moving to produce domestic supplies of gas to ensure they are not left without power in the event of other crises limiting access to foreign energy, Euractiv reports.

The Dutch, for example, announced a joint Dutch-German North Sea natural gas drilling operation that had been blocked by the German state of Lower Saxony was now moving forward, the German state having withdrawn its objections. Drilling is expected to begin in 2024.

In addition, Albania, Italy, Romania, and Slovakia are all moving forward with plans to develop domestic reserves of natural gas, Euractiv reports.

For many EU governments, energy security, or at least the desire to have electric power and thus stay in political power, are evidently trumping climate commitments.

Dark Clouds on the Horizon for Electric Vehicles,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","There are a couple of dark clouds hanging over the optimistic growth of electric vehicles (EV’s) that may decimate the supply chain of lithium to make the EV batteries, and how to safely transport EV’s across wide oceans.

The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is expected to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health. The decision is expected to be reached by early next year. The recent (March 2022) sinking of a cargo ship with 4,000 vehicles, from a fire where electric-vehicle batteries were part of the reason, may be imposing an insurmountable insurance problem to bring those foreign made vehicles to America

The first dark cloud is the supply chain for lithium to build EV batteries:

Lithium’s pivotal role in electric vehicles makes it an important commodity in meeting global targets to cut carbon emissions, and it was added to the EU’s list of critical raw materials in 2020. However, the European Commission is currently assessing a proposal by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to classify lithium carbonate, chloride, and hydroxide as dangerous for human health.

The EU proposal doesn’t ban lithium imports, from developing countries where the same lithium carbonate, chloride and hydroxide are currently NOT categorized as dangerous for human health. But if legislated will add to costs for processors from more stringent rules controlling processing, packaging, and storage. The decision is expected to be reached by early next year

Adding lithium salts to the list of materials hazardous for health may prompt the revision of a range of projects in the industry. Stricter rules mean higher costs, so any lithium ore processing plant project would need to be given a second look regarding its environmental impact and feasibility.

If lithium carbonate, lithium chloride and lithium hydroxide are classified as dangerous, it would complicate the import procedure, production, and handling of the materials.

The top lithium producer in Germany, Albemarle Corp (ALB.N), may have to shut its Langelsheim plant in Germany if the metal used in electric vehicle batteries is declared a hazardous material by the European Union..

Like America’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the European Union has been making its environmental and climate rules stricter for decades. The administration in Brussels wants to make the entire continent carbon neutral by mid-century. At the same time, it is striving to achieve the highest level of protection from pollution in the world.

Initiatives to open mines and ore processing plants such as the ones in Serbia and Portugal have caused a public uproar as environmentalists and the local population are fearful about the impact on nature and people’s livelihoods. In other projects, engineers are trying to make the extraction of lithium from geothermal waters cost effective and harmless, without any mining. Currently, Portugal has called off a lithium project amid EU’s scramble for battery materials.

The second dark cloud is the insurability of future cargo ships to bring EV’s to America:

Amid tougher emissions regulations worldwide, established automakers are racing to add more EVs to their lineup. A Reuters analysis found that global automakers such as Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Fiat, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Daimler, and Chrysler plan to spend a combined U.S. $300 billion on EVs over the next decade as car companies are betting big on EV’s. Most of the EV’s will be manufactured in foreign countries far removed from American ports.

China came from zero production in 1950, to 2019 where it now produces more cars than the USA, Japan, and India collectively. The 6-minute video of the automobile manufacturing “needle” shows how the foreign manufacturing dominance occurred over the that 69-year period.

Automobiles manufactured per year 1950/2019:

China None / 28 million

United States 8 million / 11 million

Japan 31 thousand / 9.8 million

India 15 thousand / 5 million

Germany 300 thousand / 5 million

South Korea None / 4 million

Bringing those foreign built cars to America may be an insurmountable insurance problem. The Felicity Ace, a 650-foot-long cargo ship carrying hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of luxury cars sunk in March 2022. The salvage crew working on the burning ship said electric-vehicle batteries were part of the reason it was still aflame after several days. The estimated market value of the Felicity Ace was $24.5 million, while the total value of the 3965 vehicles could be over $500 million.

With potential fires from EV batteries, who’s going to take the insurance responsibility for their safe passage from the foreign manufacturers to American ports, the cargo ships, or the manufacturers?

On the positive side, there are sodium-ion batteries that are the main pretender to the throne for EV’s.

Chinese giant CATL’s first generation of sodium-ion batteries are entering the market in 2023. If the company makes up for the lag in energy density, the new technology may become more competitive than lithium-based solutions.

The sodium-ion technology has better integration efficiency, performance at low temperatures and charging speed. Experts noted that sodium-ion batteries can be charged only 1,500 times compared to between two and four times more in the case of lithium variants. Thus, longevity of the sodium-ion batteries still needs development work.

Lithium-ion batteries are dominating the global energy storage market including electric vehicles. However, the sector’s rapid expansion is fueling price growth and drastic shortages are possible as soon as next year. Also, quality lithium ore is scarce and producers across the world are under fire for extensive water consumption in the process and other environmental impacts. Currently, sodium-ion batteries are the main pretender to the throne.

Until something like an alternative sodium-ion battery comes along to replace the lithium-ion batteries, to meet the projected growth of the EV population, the industry will be monitoring the dark clouds hanging over the industry for a reliable lithium supply chain for electric vehicles, as well as methods to transport those EV’s safely and cost-effectively to America.

EPA Now Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place on CO2,David Wojick,"There are lots of happy reports on the Supreme Court’s ruling throwing out EPA’s so-called Clean Power Plan. Some go so far as to suggest that EPA is barred from regulating power plant CO2 emissions.

It is not quite that simple and the result is rather amusing. EPA is still required to regulate CO2 under the terms of the Clean Air Act, but that Act provides no way to do that regulation. The Clean Power Plan attempted to expand an obscure minor clause in the Act to do the job but SCOTUS correctly ruled that the clause does not confer that kind of massive authority.

EPA is between a rock and a hard place. It should tell Congress that it cannot do the job and needs a new law, along the lines of the SO2 law added to the Act in 1990, curbing emissions. But such a law has zero chance of passing in the foreseeable future.

EPA is stuck. What they will now do is anybody’s guess. Enjoy their dilemma!

Here is a bit more detail on the situation.

On one hand EPA’s legal mandate to regulate CO2 under the Clean Air Act is clear. First the (prior) Supreme Court ruled that CO2 was a “pollutant” under the Act. This is because buried in the 1990 Amendments was a clause adding causing climate change to the definition of “pollutant”. The Court accepted the government’s claim that the CO2 increase could cause climate change. The new Court could change this but is unlikely to do so.

Given CO2 as a pollutant under the Act, EPA was required to decide if it was dangerous to human well being or not. It then produced an “endangerment finding” saying that CO2 was indeed a threat.

Given these two steps the Act then requires EPA to regulate CO2. It has been trying to figure out how to do so ever since.

The deep problem is that the Clean Air Act specifies very specific regulatory actions, none of which work for CO2. This is because CO2 is nothing like the true pollutants that the Act was developed to regulate.

The Act’s mainline mechanism is the NAAQS (pronounced “nacks”) which stands for National Ambient Air Quality Standards. These standards specify the ambient concentration levels allowed for various pollutants. Carbon dioxide’s cousin carbon monoxide is one of these pollutants. Locations that exceed the NAAQS receive stiff penalties.

Clearly this mechanism assumes that local levels are due to local emissions, which can be controlled to achieve and maintain compliance.

But CO2 is nothing like that. There is no way America can control the ambient CO2 level. Even if humans are causing that level (which is itself controversial), it is then based on global emissions. CO2 is not a local pollutant.

For a CO2 NAAQS EPA could either set the standard below the global level or above it. If below then all of America would be out of compliance and subject to the Act’s penalties, with no way to comply. It is very unlikely that the Court’s would allow these universal endless penalties.

If the CO2 NAAQS were above the present level then there would be no legal basis for EPA taking any action, since compliance was complete.

So the NAAQS mechanism simply does not work.

Another major mechanism is to control the emissions of what are called “hazardous air pollutants” or HAPS. EPA explains it this way:

“Hazardous air pollutants are those known to cause cancer and other serious health impacts. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to regulate toxic air pollutants, also known as air toxics, from categories of industrial facilities.”

But CO2 is nontoxic, so not a HAP. In fact our exhaled breath contains over one hundred times the ambient level of CO2, that is over 40,000 ppm. Clearly if ambient 400 ppm CO2 were toxic we would all be dead. It would be absurd for EPA to try to classify CO2 as a HAP. No Court would stand for it.

The only other piece of Clean Air Act that EPA might try to use is called “New Source Performance Standards” but as the name says they only apply to new construction (or major modifications). The myriad existing fossil fueled power plants that supply our daily juice would not be covered. Even worse if EPA drove up the cost of new gas fired plants we would likely restart the host of retired coal fueled plants. What a hoot that would be!

So there you have it. EPA bought itself CO2 as a Clean Air Act pollutant, but there is no way under the Act to regulate it. To mix metaphors, EPA is all dressed up with no place to go. The Supreme Court decision returned EPA to its regulatory dead end.

I find this ridiculous situation to be truly laughable. What were they thinking? Does the EPA Administrator understand this? Has he told the President? How about Congress?

EPA’s problem with CO2 is much deeper than the latest Supreme Court Decision. The Clean Air Act simply does not work for CO2. What will EPA do?

Sterling Burnett,"Although the 2022 hurricane season has gotten off to slow start, the forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center say the 2022 season will be more active than the long-term average. Whether this proves to be true only time will tell, but research is increasingly making clear that the modest warming of the planet has not caused hurricanes to grow more frequent or severe.

Even the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledges it has detected no trend of increasing frequency or severity of tropical cyclones and has no evidence human greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to any trend.

A recent post by University of Colorado-Boulder professor Roger Pielke Jr. reinforces a point Climate Realism and Climate at a Glance: Hurricanes have repeatedly made: there has been no increase in the frequency or severity of hurricanes during the recent period of modest global warming.

Pielke is particularly well-suited to write about this topic, having served as a post-doc at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research, doing research on hurricanes and floods. His interest in the topic has continued to this day.

Pielke notes five points of fact about hurricanes:

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) finds “no consensus” on the relative role of human influences on Atlantic hurricane activity, quoting the IPCC as follows: “there is still no consensus on the relative magnitude of human and natural influences on past changes in Atlantic hurricane activity, … and it remains uncertain whether past changes in Atlantic TC activity are outside the range of natural variability.”

“The IPCC has concluded that since 1900 there is ‘no trend in the frequency of USA landfall events.’ This goes for all hurricanes and also for the strongest hurricanes, called major hurricanes.”

“Since at least 1980, there are no clear trends in overall global hurricane and major hurricane activity.”

“There are many characteristics of tropical cyclones that are under study and hypothesized to be potentially affected by human influences, … but at present there is not a unified community consensus on these hypotheses, as summarized by the World Meteorological Organization,” as to whether any of the factors are affected by human greenhouse gas emissions.

“Hurricanes are common, incredibly destructive and will always be with us. Even so, we have learned a lot about how to prepare and recover.”

Pielke points out that some of the costliest hurricanes occurred in the early part of the twentieth century when average global temperatures were cooler than at present.

Data indicates that although the monetary costs of hurricanes have increased as more infrastructure and valuable property has been constructed on coasts prone to hurricane activity, the real, inflation-adjusted cost of hurricanes has declined significantly as a percentage of national and global GDP, and the number of lives lost has dropped even more steeply. We are better-prepared now—with better warning and tracking systems; better communications; improved, hardened infrastructure; and better post-hurricane recovery technology and responses—than ever before.

Two recent studies in journals published by the prominent peer-reviewed Nature provide additional evidence global warming hasn’t increased the threats hurricanes pose. Research published in Nature Climate Change concludes the evidence is robust that tropical cyclones have trended downward in number globally and in every individual cyclone region across the course of the twentieth century.

In that paper, an international team of 12 researchers from universities and institutes in Australia, China, and the United States reconstructed past hurricane activity since the 1850s across the various hurricane basins. They used proxy data for past hurricanes because before the era of radar, airplanes dedicated to storm tracking, and satellites, it was virtually impossible to know whether a hurricane formed in the open ocean unless a ship happened to cross its path or it eventually made landfall.

The scientists found a peak of hurricane formation across the various basins in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with a fairly steady decline in hurricanes across the twentieth century for every basin but one. Beginning in the 1950s, the number of hurricanes began to increase in the North Atlantic Basin. However, even in the North Atlantic, where the decline has reversed, the average annual number of hurricanes still has not reached the peak experienced in the early part of the hurricane record.

The study reports the annual number of global tropical cyclones—hurricanes, typhoons, and tropical storms—declined by approximately 13 percent as the planet warmed during the twentieth century. They suggest several factors related to warming might have contributed to the decline, such as changes in the Hadley and Walker tropical ocean circulation patterns and an increase in wind shear.

“What’s happening with global warming is that these underlying conditions are getting more unfavorable for cyclones to form in the first place,” Savin Chand, lead author of the study and a senior lecturer at the Federation University in Australia, told CNN.

Although Chand indicated to CNN the same conditions that have resulted in fewer hurricanes might be contributing to them becoming more severe, neither hard data nor Chand’s own research backs up this claim. Regarding this point, the paper by Chand et al. states “the resolutions of the current reanalysis products are too coarse to make conclusions about TC intensity.”

Additional research contradicting the alarmist dogma that climate change is making hurricanes worse was published recently in Nature Communications. Examining the formation of major hurricanes in the North Atlantic Basin since 1851, the study found any reported increase in Atlantic hurricane formation or of major hurricanes in the region suggested by previous research was due to “changes in observing practices, [particularly] a substantial increase in monitoring capacity over the past 170 years.”

After adjusting for past undercounts of North Atlantic Basin hurricanes in general and major hurricanes in particular, the researchers conclude as follows:

We find here that, once we include a correction for undercounts in the pre-satellite era basin-wide NA HU [hurricane] and MH [major hurricane] frequency, there are no significant increases in either basin-wide HU or MH frequency, or in the MH/HU ratio for the Atlantic basin between 1878 and 2019…. The homogenized basin-wide HU and MH record does not show strong evidence of a century-scale increase in either MH frequency or MH/HU ratio associated with the century-scale, greenhouse-gas-induced warming of the planet. For example, the temporal evolution of the global mean temperature is not closely reflected in the temporal evolution of adjusted MH/HU ratio.

Hurricanes large and small will form and strike land. That’s a natural process. What is clear is that thus far there is no evidence to suggest tropical cyclones are forming more frequently, becoming stronger, or lasting longer than they did before humans began adding significant amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In short, the data does not support the claim that global warming is making hurricanes worse.

INDONESIA GOES GREEN—WITH COAL, LIKE CHINA AND INDIA … RECORD COLD STRIKES SOUTH AMERICA, AUSTRALIA, UNITED STATES

INDONESIA GOES GREEN—WITH COAL, LIKE CHINA AND INDIA

Indonesia’s parliament is considering a bill to address climate change that explicitly counts coal as green and expands the development and use of coal as a necessary step in meeting the country’s growing energy needs.

The draft bill proposes classifying coal bed methane, coal liquefaction, and coal gasification as sources of “new energy’ alongside nuclear and hydrogen power. The bill also calls for expanding use of renewables.

Despite pledging to end the use of coal and become net-zero by 2060, Indonesia remains the world’s largest exporter of coal for energy production, and the draft plan seems to endorse continued exports of coal, which is a significant source of government revenue. Coal is also used to generate approximately 60 percent of the nation’s electricity, five times the share generated by all renewables combined. To ensure the country has sufficient coal supplies for domestic energy consumption, the new law would require that 30 percent of all coal sales be for internal use, an increase from the current floor of 25 percent.

In a concession to climate commitments, the bill proposes to compensate the state power company for any monetary losses it suffers in developing new renewable power sources, and it provides subsidies and land and infrastructure grants for new power generating units, including both coal and renewable sources.

RECORD COLD STRIKES SOUTH AMERICA, AUSTRALIA, UNITED STATES

Below-average, even record-setting low temperatures are breaking out across the globe despite alarmists’ repeated warnings that such cold spells should be artifacts of the past because of global warming.

Heartland Institute analyst Linnea Lueken writes that as the Southern Hemisphere shifted into winter this year, a multitude of media outlets have been reporting unprecedented cold snaps and record-setting low temperatures and amounts of snow and ice in South America and Australia. Nature World News, for example, reports Tasmania is suffering from an “Antarctic blast,” and the Associated Press says Brazil’s homeless population is suffering because of “unusually low temperatures.”

The Guardian acknowledges the cause of the unusually cold temperatures across a wide swath of the southern hemisphere is the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the current dry conditions in the U.S. Southwest are also being driven by the PDO.

Down Under, the cold, wet weather is so bad that news outlets are reporting many Australians have been forced to cancel their ski trips because parks are closed because there is too much snow.

Ignoring the natural factors driving Australia’s current cold spell, Australia’s Daily Mail hypes climate change, writing, “The lead researcher on a major investigation into ocean currents altered by global warming told Daily Mail Australia that the changes making wet, cooler weather more likely for Australia are already underway.” The Daily Mail makes it sound like chillier conditions are about to become a permanent fact of life in Australia. OK, but just last year alarmists were claiming heat waves and drought were becoming Australia’s new normal, likewise caused by climate change, as detailed in Climate Realism.

Argentina just completed its coldest autumn in the last 46 years. Electroverse reports the northern part of the country is experiencing temperatures -3°C below normal, with a more recent post reporting La Quiaca river froze, at -12.1°C. As far north as Peru, sea surface temperatures are below average, and the mountain region of Chuapalca, Peru hit -21.6°C. Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay also reported record cold temperatures. Paraguay’s record cold was broken this June, hitting -5.1°C. The capital of Brazil suffered record-breaking cold at 1.4°C; and São Paulo reported its coldest temperatures since the 1990s.

Closer to home, snow and very cold temperatures struck New Hampshire and other states in the Northeast over Father’s Day weekend. In fact, multiple cities and regions across the northern tier of the continental United States experienced temperatures well below average.

“What to expect from Seattle-area weather after 2 record-breaking cool, wet months,” the Seattle Times lamented. “After the coolest April and May in decades, Western Washington is in store for another month of cooler and wetter weather, according to the Climate Prediction Center’s 30-day forecast for June.” In New Hampshire, cameras at the Mt. Washington Observatory showed blustery snow and ice on Father’s Day weekend, Heartland Institute President James Taylor reports. The observatory warned people against frostbite and hypothermia if they ventured outdoors at Mt. Washington or other area mountains as the Northern Hemisphere headed toward the summer solstice and the longest day of the year.

The inland northern tier of the continental United States has also been hit with an unusually cold spring and early summer. Pittsburgh and the outlying areas of the city experienced record-breaking cold temperatures in the 40s on June 20, breaking a 143-year-old record-low temperature for that date.

Nature, it seems, is not in on the fix. It is producing cold weather that undermines the charade that the world faces inexorable, disastrous global warming caused by human greenhouse gas emissions.

PRESS RELEASE: Heartland Institute Praises Supreme Court Decision Reining in EPA Power to Regulate Carbon Dioxide,"James Taylor, H. Sterling Burnett, Anthony Watts, S. T. Karnick, Linnea Lueken","ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (June 30, 2022) – The United States Supreme Court today in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ruled the agency overstepped its statutory authority in regulating emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants.

“Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal to generate electricity may be a sensible ‘solution to the crisis of the day’,” wrote Chief Justice John Roberts for the 6-3 majority decision. “But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme. A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body.”

Since 2015, the EPA has claimed the Clean Air Act and the Obama-era Clean Power Plan granted it the power to limit CO2 emissions from power plants, severely restricting the ability of coal and natural gas plants – which power most of the United States – to operate. West Virginia, two coal companies, and North Dakota sued EPA to end the regulation.

“At bottom, the Clean Power Plan essentially adopted a cap-and-trade scheme, or set of state cap-and-trade schemes, for carbon,” Roberts wrote. “Congress, however, has consistently rejected proposals to amend the Clean Air Act to create such a program. It has also declined to enact similar measures, such as a carbon tax.”

“This is a win for our constitutional republic, our nation’s economy, and our energy security. EPA efforts to add greenhouse gases as pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, absent congressional authority, was extreme overreach. On major questions such as limiting the nation’s energy supply and thus hampering interstate commerce and trade, Congress alone has the authority to act, not executive agencies in pursuit of mission creep or goals endorsed by the executive.

“Congress has repeatedly considered rules to restrict carbon dioxide emissions, and has never approved them. This ruling should shore up our power grid. Beyond that, it should give pause to the schemes of other federal agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to impose restrictions on or reporting requirements concerning greenhouse gas emissions. If the EPA can’t limit greenhouse gases, neither can they impose such limits.”

“The Biden White House argued the Clean Air Act gave the EPA broad powers, including regulating carbon dioxide, which isn’t a pollutant at all, but an intrinsic part of the photosynthesis of plants and a key part of the life cycle on this planet.

“The justices ruled the agency is overstepping its power and therefore have set the stage for curtailing over-regulation in the name of ‘climate change.’ This is a breath of fresh air and shows that wisdom and common sense prevailed.”

“The Supreme Court rightly stayed in its lane in this case, as the Trump Court has increasingly been doing, restoring the separation of powers that is necessary to avert tyranny while leaving policy questions to Congress.

“Ruling narrowly on whether the EPA was operating under authority granted by Congress in declaring carbon dioxide a pollutant, the Court correctly determined that the agency had overstepped its bounds, and that is that. Regardless of one’s opinion of the policy the rule was meant to establish, the EPA had no authority to impose it. That is how real judges judge.”

Biden’s proposed windfall profits tax will make America less energy secure,Bernard (Bud) Weinstein,"On June 10, while visiting Los Angeles, President Biden pointed at big energy companies as the culprits for rising gasoline prices. He lambasted the industry by claiming they would rather use their record profits to buy back stock than to drill for oil. He also pressured domestic companies to ramp up production while simultaneously threatening them with a windfall profits tax. Pressure ramped up again on June 14 with a series of letters by the president to various companies asking for concrete solutions to increase supply.

Contrary to Biden’s claim that the industry isn’t developing domestic leases, some oil and gas companies are planning to boost output in the Permian Basin alone by 25 percent this year, while expanding refining capacity by 250,000 barrels per day. That’s equivalent to building a medium-sized refinery. Other major and independent domestic oil companies are also planning to boost production. But this won’t happen overnight, especially in a regulatory and policy environment that remains basically hostile to fossil fuels.

Recent examples include the curtailment of new leases for drilling; regulatory and legal obstacles for new pipeline development; increased mandates for ethanol blending; and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) regulations designed to discourage new financing of fossil fuel projects. In addition, oil and gas companies face the same supply-chain constraints and rising costs as other industries.

Against this backdrop, on June 14, Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) announced he would soon introduce legislation setting a 21 percent surtax on the excess profits of oil and gas companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue and use those revenues to provide a gasoline subsidy for American consumers. Proponents of the tax allege it’s time for the industry to pay its fair share of the nation’s tax bill. What’s more, argue supporters, the current windfall is the result of geopolitical events — e.g., Russia’s war in Ukraine — and not an outcome of strategic company investment decisions.

Those advocating for a windfall profits tax need to take a hard look at economic and fiscal realities. Forgotten in the debate is the fact that the oil and gas industry already contributes mightily to federal and state coffers. Prior to the pandemic, the industry paid $160 million in federal corporate income taxes along with another $4.2 billion in royalties from production on federal lands. That represented 19.3 percent of net income, compared to 10.6 percent on average for all industries. What is more, in some states the energy industry is the single largest taxpayer. For example, oil and gas companies paid $15.8 billion in state and local taxes and royalties to the state of Texas in 2021.

Here are some more inconvenient facts. In 2021, U.S. energy firms were the 10th most profitable sector of the U.S. economy out of 11, according to S&P Global IQ. Energy firms listed in the S&P 500 stock index posted an 8.3 percent profit margin in 2021. That was below the median for all 11 sectors, which was 10.6 percent. Furthermore, prior to the recent run-up in oil prices, the average net profit for oil and gas drilling was only 4.7 percent. In short, high profits are an exception, not the rule, for the oil and gas industry.

In practice, imposing a tax on the earnings of energy companies likely would backfire, leading to less — not more — oil and gas production.

This was the case after enactment of the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act in 1980 (U.S. Public Law 96-223), under the Jimmy Carter administration, in response to the OPEC oil embargo and the Iranian Revolution of the previous decade that led to sharply higher gasoline prices and growing profits for domestic and international oil companies. It went into effect at a time when the American economy was on the verge of a recession — much like today — and the law’s implementation was expensive and revenues proved to be well below expectations. Domestic production dropped from 8.7 million barrels per day in 1980 to 7.5 million barrels per day in 1988, proving that if you want less of something, tax it! The tax was repealed in 1988, by which time oil imports had risen by almost 1 million barrels per day.

After focusing for more than a decade on the need to reduce carbon emissions, we now face a new paradigm as the war in Ukraine has returned energy security to center stage. Though still pushing renewable energy and electric vehicles, Biden says he wants more domestic oil production while consumers and businesses are demanding lower energy prices. A revived windfall profits tax won’t get us there. Instead, it likely would raise prices, increase our reliance on imports, and do nothing to stimulate more domestic production. If the past is prologue, it will actually diminish America’s energy security.

Hurricane risk is real for offshore wind,David Wojick,"My regular readers know that I have been fussing about the threat of hurricanes destroying proposed Atlantic coast offshore wind arrays. The issue arises because the offshore wind industry is based in Europe, which does not get hurricanes. My focus has been Dominion’s massive project off Virginia, but the whole East Coast is hurricane alley.

Now I have found some research that actually quantifies the threat and it is very real. It looks like wind generators will have to be redesigned specifically to withstand hurricanes. In fact that work is underway. In the meantime we should not be building conventional offshore wind towers.

The 2017 press release is succinctly titled “Offshore wind turbines vulnerable to Category 5 hurricane gusts.” The PR says this: “The study, which was conducted in collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, and the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, highlights the limitations of current turbine design and could provide guidance for manufacturers and engineers looking to build more hurricane-resilient turbines in the future.”

We certainly want hurricane-resilient turbines! Actually they also mean towers and blades, not just the turbines. It is the towers and blades that are most likely to collapse in extreme wind, although the turbines can be damaged as well.

The research report itself has a more specific but equally scary title: “Gusts and shear within hurricane eyewalls can exceed offshore wind turbine design standards.”

Mind you what they did is computer modeling. But what they found confirms prior observations that people were having trouble believing.

Simply put they found that hurricane wind gusts can hit an incredible 200 miles per hour (mph), while wind towers are only designed to withstand 160 mph. If those extreme gusts hit an offshore wind farm, catastrophe is pretty much guaranteed.

In addition to extremely damaging gusts, the press release says this: “Furthermore, current standards do not account for veer, a measure of the change in wind direction across a vertical span. In the simulation, wind direction changed by as much as 55 degrees between the tip of the rotor and its hub, creating a potentially dangerous strain on the blade.”

Here is how they make the fundamental point:

“The findings could be used to help wind farm developers improve design standards as well as to help stakeholders make informed decisions about the costs, benefits and risks of placing turbines in hurricane-prone areas.”

I have yet to see any sort of hurricane risk assessment from any of the proposed East Coast wind projects, most of which involve billions of dollars. In the Virginia case, the primary stakeholders are the ratepayers who are on the hook for an estimated ten billion dollars. In their case hurricanes have not even been mentioned by Dominion.

A more recent article comes to similar conclusions—”Hurricane eyewall winds and structural response of wind turbines“

The article is technical but here is their plain language summary:

“Offshore wind energy is a burgeoning area of renewable energy that is at an early stage of development in the United States. Exposure of offshore wind turbines to hurricanes must be assessed and mitigated to ensure the security of the renewable energy supply. This research assesses the impact of hurricane wind fields on the structural response of wind turbines. Such wind fields have characteristics that may pose heretofore unforeseen structural challenges to offshore wind turbines.”

I have not done a literature search but there may well be a large literature on this huge problem. If so then the wind developers are carefully ignoring it.

Before we build tens or hundreds of billions of dollars worth of massive offshore wind facilities off the East Coast we need to be sure that they will withstand strong hurricanes. (It may well be that even Category 4 hurricanes will exceed today’s design standards.) Otherwise both the ratepayers and the grid will be at great risk.

This hurricane design case may be something that NERC should Issue a Reliability Standard on. Such a Reliability Standard would lay out the kind of hurricane risk assessment that must be done as part of the facility design process. These risk assessments need to then be made part of the public decision process.

Offshore wind should not fly blindly into the teeth of the storm. Too much is at risk.

Shortages and Inflation to be the New Norm as Refinery Closures Outpace New Construction,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","As the world has become impassioned with increasing its electricity generation from wind turbines and solar panels from breezes and sunshine, the world is silently slipping into a future of shortages and inflation as society’s demands for all the products and fuels manufactured from crude oil is exceeding the supply available from the dwindling number of refineries.

There were almost 700 oil refineries in the world as of January 2020, but as a result on continuous over regulations, permitting delays, aging equipment, and the worldwide support of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) to divest in fossil fuels, the right operating model and level of integration will be crucial for survival and sustained profitability of refineries.

In 2019 there were 135 refineries in the U.S. but five facilities were shuttered during the last two years.

Each refinery location is a business that needs to make business decisions. Consequently, one in five oil refineries are expected to cease operations over the next five years. One in five is 20 percent, or almost 140 refineries expected to be shuttered worldwide, resulting in a 20 percent decline in the products manufactured to meet the ever-increasing demands form society.

There are over 100 new refineries under construction, with most of them in Asia with 88, Europe with 12 and North America with 10. Asia is the region with the greatest number of future petroleum refineries. As of 2021, there were 88 new facilities in planning or under construction in Asia. By comparison, Europe is set to see an addition of12 petroleum refinery, and North America is set to see an addition of 10. The amount of oil fed through refineries in Asia has significantly increased in the past three decades as demand for petroleum products surged in developing countries such as China and India. China is on track to succeed the United States as the country with the greatest oil refinery throughput.

While worldwide demand for the products made with oil derivatives and fuels manufactured at refineries continue to increase, the upcoming closures of manufacturers over the next five years will significantly reduce the supply of those items and place tremendous pressures on continuous shortages and inflation.

Renewables can only generate electricity, and intermittent electricity at best. The undisputable science is that renewables CANNOT manufacture any of the oil derivatives that are the basis of the thousands of products that are the foundation of societies and economies around the world. In fact, renewables cannot exist without crude oil as all the parts of wind turbines and solar panels are made with oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

Here is a reminder of what is manufactured from oil that did not exist before 1900 that are needed to support the growing demands of the world’s economy and for the health and well-being of the world’s eight billion residents:

Fuels for the:

50,000 heavy-weight and long-range merchant ships that are moving products throughout the world.

50,000 heavy-weight and long-range jets used by commercial airlines, private usage, and the military.

The 290 million registered vehicles in the U.S. as of 2021, that were comprised of about 56 percent trucks, 40 percent cars, and 4 percent motorcycles.

The cruise ships that now move twenty-five million passengers around the world.

Oil derivatives to make thousands of products such as:

Tires for the billions of vehicles.

Asphalt for the millions of miles of roadways.

Water filtration systems.

Sanitation systems.

Fertilizers that come from natural gas to help feed billions.

Pesticides to control locusts and other pests.

Wind turbines and solar panels as they are all made with products from fossil fuels.

With worldwide refinery closures outpacing new construction, shortages and inflation are likely to be the new norm that inflict regressive expenses upon those that can least afford it.","June 22, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/shortages-and-inflation-to-be-the-new-norm-as-refinery-closures-outpace-new-construction/
Net-zero Reality Check #1 – Wind Only,Donn Dears,"(This is the first of four articles, using published data and simple logic, to demonstrate net-zero carbon is unattainable by 2050 with wind, solar or nuclear, or a combination of these methods for power generation.) This analysis reflects ONLY United States energy demand and production by source.

The critical issue addressed in these studies is whether the required number of wind turbines, PV solar or nuclear power plants can be built, or whether a combination of them can be built, to achieve net-zero by 2050. The answer developed by the articles is that the required number of wind turbines, PV solar or nuclear power plants can’t separately, or in combination, be built by 2050

The total number of new wind turbines to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050 is: 995,141

Climate change scaremongers insist we eliminate the use of fossil fuels.

But what does that really entail?

Here is the first reality check: Can wind turbines achieve net-zero carbon?

Three steps are required to determine the number of wind turbines needed to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050.

Step 1

Step one determines the number of new wind turbines needed to replace all the electricity generated by fossil fuels in 2021.

Wind produced 380 billion kWh, or 9.2% of all the electricity generated in 2021.

The average nameplate rating of existing wind turbines in the United States is approximately 2.5 MW. Based on a Capacity Factor of 32% for these turbines, there were 54,244 wind turbines in the US in 2021.

Subtracting nuclear and renewables from total generation determines the kWh generated by fossil fuels. Dividing the kWh produced by fossil fuels, by the kWh generated per wind turbine determines the number of additional wind turbines needed to replace the electricity produced by fossil fuels in 2021.

Number of new wind turbines needed to replace fossil fuels = 358,447

Step 2

Step two is to determine the new wind turbines needed to supply the electricity needed when light vehicles are all battery-powered, and homes use electricity for heating rather than natural gas. The national renewable energy lab (NREL) has determined that total electricity consumption will double when all light vehicles are BEVs and homes rely on electricity for heating. Hydro can’t be doubled, and without increasing other miscellaneous renewables, the additional electricity generated by wind turbines will equal the amunt generated by all methods in 2021, i.e., 4,116 billion kWh.

Number of new wind turbines to double electricity consumption by 2050 = 587,329

Step 3

Step three is to determine the number of new wind turbines needed to generate the electricity required to produce enough hydrogen to make steel and cement that meet net-zero carbon requirements. There’s little reliable data on using hydrogen in the making of cement, while there is considerable data for using hydrogen in the making of steel. The estimate shown here for the number of new wind turbines is based on the amount of hydrogen required to make 62 million tons of steel, which excludes the amount of steel made using scrap in electric arc furnaces, and then doubling the number of wind turbines to compensate for the production of cement. (The United States produced 87.9 million tons of steel in 2021.)

Number of new wind turbines required to generate the electricity used by electrolyzers to produce the hydrogen to make steel and cement = 49,365

Summary

The total number of new wind turbines to achieve net-zero carbon by 2050 is: 995,141

358,447 + 587,329 + 49,365 = 995,141

The average number of wind turbines installed in one year after 2004 was 3,000, which, at that rate, means it will take 332 years to install all the wind turbines needed to achieve net-zero.

The maximum number ever installed in one year was 5,680 which, at that rate, would mean it would take 175 years to install all the needed wind turbines.

Wind turbines larger than 2.5 MW are under development, mostly for off-shore installations, however a very few units rated 5 MW or more have been installed in the US. Recognizing there is a possibility that units rated 5 MW might be installed in the US:

It would be necessary to install 17,770 units rated 5 MW every year over the 28 years between now and 2050. This is three times the number of smaller units ever installed in one year.

Additional considerations

Nuclear power plants are scheduled to be shut down beginning in 2032, with all existing nuclear power plants shut down by 2064. There is no provision in the above calculations for the additional wind turbines needed to replace the nuclear power plants shut down before 2050.

Wind turbines have an expected life of 20 years. This means that:

All 54,244 wind turbines installed before 2022 will also have to be replaced before 2050.

All wind turbines built between now and 2030 will also have to be replaced before 2050.

These additional wind turbines have not been included in the above calculations.

Batteries are required to provide back up for when the wind doesn’t blow. No battery has yet been invented that can provide the needed amount of storage to replace the electricity lost if the wind fails to blow for a week or two.

Conclusion

If wind turbines are used in an attempt to eliminate fossil fuels, it will require building over 995,141 new wind turbines rated 2.5 MW between now and 2050.

The largest number of wind turbines ever installed in one year was 5,680, which means it would take 175 years to build the necessary number of units rated 2.5 MW.

If larger 5 MW units were used it would require installing over 17,770 units every year between now and 2050, which is three times the number of smaller units ever installed in one year.

And of course, storage using batteries that have yet to be developed will also be required.

This reality check should give everyone pause, as it demonstrates that it’s not possible to eliminate fossil fuels using wind turbines.

Net-zero carbon cannot be achieved using wind turbines.

Climate Realism on the Rise?,H. Sterling Burnett,"As a climate and energy realist, in my heart of hearts I dream of the day when the public recognizes climate change will not bring on an end of the world as we know it, or even a long-term net decline for human civilization. That’s what the data and the best science show, despite the claims of corporate media, alarmist activists, heads of corporations, and politicians who profit in terms of money and power by spinning the climate change end-of-the-world fairy tale. Sadly, the public rarely gets to hear this truth.

A few notable instances of the very unalarming facts about climate change getting through on a large scale in the past few years are the release of several bestselling books by prominent liberals advocating what they consider to be reasonable climate policies: Michael Shellenberger’s Apocalypse Never, Steven Koonin’s Unsettled, and Bjorn Lomborg’s False Alarm. Sticking strictly to climate science, not policy, Heartland’s own Climate at a Glance for Teachers and Students has also sold well on Amazon. However, despite the success of these publications among the literati and reading public, I’d be surprised if these books combined sold more than a million copies in the United States, which has a population of more than 330 million people, or a few million copies among the eight billion people worldwide. Sadly, I suspect more people are exposed to false climate alarm stories in the mainstream media every day in the United States than have been reached by all these books in the past two years since the first one’s release.

Still, hope springs eternal and climate realists keep on plugging away, trying to breach the nearly impregnable wall of climate change disinformation erected by powerful corporate, media, and political elites. Every so often, the realists score a direct hit, making the climate/energy realist case so powerfully that even the mainstream media and elite journals take notice. This occurred recently when The New York Times Magazine (NYTM) published an interview with eminent scientist Vaclav Smil, Ph.D., discussing his book How the World Really Works: The Science Behind How We Got Here and Where We’re Going.” (You can’t get more mainstream and yet elitist than the NYTM.) Another direct realist hit on the edifice of climate alarm came with the publication of the article “Russia’s War Is the End of Climate Policy as We Know It,” in the journal Foreign Affairs, by Ted Nordhaus.

Both Smil and Nordhaus have far more confidence than I that human activities are causing potentially dangerous climate change. Although I disagree to some extent with their assessment of the dangers of climate change, their “realpolitik” analyses of the infeasibility of the net zero energy transition in the 2030-2050 timeline are powerful and accurate.

Despite continual cajoling by the NYTM interviewer, who basically framed the same question again and again and again, pleading for Smil to concede climate change is such an imminent disaster world leaders must forcibly decarbonize our energy systems nearly immediately, Smil refused to rise to the bait. His consistent answer, based on his assessment of the world’s energy needs and the material requirements necessary to meet net zero in the short term, was that this goal is physically and politically impossible. Smil also made clear that the threat posed by climate change does not justify such a dramatic forced transition.

For Smil, the four pillars of modern civilization are cement, steel, plastics, and ammonia, each of which requires huge amounts of fossil fuels to produce. Therefore, he concludes, those calling for rapid decarbonization to combat global warming are being dangerously foolish. “I’m looking at the world as it is,” Smil, told the NTYM interviewer, continuing,

The most important thing to understand is the scale. … [A]ccording to COP26, we should reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 45 percent by 2030 as compared with 2010 levels. This is undoable because there’s just eight years left, and emissions are still rising. People don’t appreciate the magnitude of the task and are setting up artificial deadlines which are unrealistic. …

What’s the point of setting goals which cannot be achieved? People call it aspirational. I call it delusional.

I’m all for goals but for strict realism in setting them.

For Smil, radical actions to cut carbon dioxide emissions steeply and immediately are neither justified by the problem—because other problems are at least as dire as climate change, and they require fossil fuels to solve—nor are they possible, even if they were justified. It’s a matter of both physics and realpolitik, the latter meaning an honest assessment of the fact that people around the world do and will continue to want to better their lives by their own understanding of what constitutes a better life.

Smil’s assessment coincides with that of Ted Nordhaus, the cofounder (with the above-mentioned Michael Shellenberger) and executive director of the Breakthrough Institute and a coauthor of An Ecomodernist Manifesto. Nordhaus’s article in Foreign Policy is a realist shot across the bow explaining how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is opening eyes to the basic energy truth that fossil fuels are still vital to the world:

[T]he headlong rush across Western Europe to replace Russian oil, gas, and coal with alternative sources of these fuels has made a mockery of the net-zero emissions pledges made by the major European economies just three months before the invasion at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Instead, questions of energy security have returned with a vengeance as countries already struggling with energy shortages and price spikes now face a fossil fuel superpower gone rogue in Eastern Europe. In the decades following the end of the Cold War, global stability and easy access to energy led many of us to forget the degree to which abundant energy is existential for modern societies. Growing concern about climate change and the push for renewable fuels also led many to underestimate just how dependent societies still are on fossil fuels. But access to oil, gas, and coal still determines the fate of nations. Two decades of worrying about carbon-fueled catastrophes—and trillions of dollars spent globally on transitioning to renewable power—haven’t changed that basic existential fact. … Given the scant effect international climate efforts have had on emissions over the past three decades, a turn back toward energy realpolitik—and away from the utopian schemes that have come to define climate advocacy and policymaking worldwide—could actually accelerate the shift to a lower-carbon global economy in the coming decades. … The capacity to adapt to rising temperatures and extreme weather events rose significantly … as evidenced by the continued decline in weather-related deaths. But this was not due to any U.N.-led efforts to fund climate adaptation, which never materialized. What made people all over the world more resilient to climate extremes was better infrastructure and safer housing—the product of economic growth powered by cheap fossil fuels. The geopolitical, technological, and economic competition that characterized the Cold War had more success in reducing the carbon intensity of the global economy than climate policy efforts have had since.

Nordhaus goes on to explain:

The world’s renewable energy economy is deeply entangled with geopolitically problematic supply chains. Huge parts of the world’s supplies of silicon, lithium, and rare-earth minerals rely on China, where solar panels are produced by Uyghur slave labor in concentration camps. The idea that the crisis might be resolved by choosing Western dependence on Chinese solar panels and batteries over Western dependence on Russian oil and gas reveals just how unserious the environmental movement’s pretensions to justice, human rights, and democracy really are.

For Nordhaus and Smil alike, the appropriate response to climate change is to acknowledge the reality of the importance of fossil fuels to continued economic prosperity for the present, while delivering better options through the market—which responds to price signals through efficiency gains and technological innovation—far faster and more effectively than government-mandated energy shifts. Smil states,

at the same time we are constantly transitioning and innovating. We went from coal to oil to natural gas, and then as we were moving into natural gas we moved into nuclear electricity, and we started building lots of large hydro, and they do not emit any carbon dioxide directly. So we’ve been transitioning to lower-carbon sources or noncarbon sources for decades. Moreover, we’ve been making our burning of carbon much more efficient. We are constantly transitioning to more efficient, more effective and less environmentally harmful things.

Nordhaus notes the Russian war is increasingly making it clear to countries that climate change is not “the main event,” energy security is, and the latter can be achieved while improving economic conditions in the poorest countries and respecting human rights:

But climate and energy policies, especially in the West, may shift significantly from subsidizing demand (for things like solar panels and electric vehicles) to deregulating supply (of things like nuclear power plants and high-voltage transmission lines). A shift of this sort—away from subsidizing specific green technologies favored by activists and lobbyists and toward enabling the broader technological, regulatory, and infrastructural basis for the energy transition—would put clean energy policies on much firmer economic footing. And it would better align climate objectives with energy security imperatives.

People around the world face many problems. Climate change is only one among many, and as Nordhaus and Smil point out, it is probably not the most pressing.

Nordhaus and Smil provide clear-eyed assessments of the physical, economic, and political limits of the energy transition demanded by climate alarmists on the timetable they have laid out. These analysts’ acknowledgements of the benefits fossil fuels have delivered, and the inequities and harms that would result from an attempt to go net zero by 2030 or even 2050, are a refreshing appraisal from scholars whom alarmists cannot in any way smear as “climate deniers.”

In my heart of hearts (foolish though it may be), I still hold out hope this truth can get through the daily background noise of climate alarm.

Decarbonization Requires Huge Amount Of Materials

DECARBONIZATION REQUIRES HUGE AMOUNT OF MATERIALS

New research published at Research Square estimates the huge increase in materials necessary to hit either the soft or hard temperature targets, 1.5℃ and 2℃ respectively, designated in the Paris climate agreement. In addition to being expensive, producing the materials will add large amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere because it requires fossil-fuel-intensive activities such as mining, refining, and transportation.

The authors find the demand for materials for the electric power sector will greatly increase the amount of battery, solar, and wind power on the grid in order to decarbonize it along the timelines in the Paris climate agreement commitments from 2020 through 2050. There is enough of these resources available, but the enormous quantities needed will require a massive increase in production.

“We find that demand increases but cumulatively does not exceed current geological reserves,” says the report. “However, annual production of materials including neodymium (Nd), dysprosium (Dy), tellurium (Te), fiberglass, and solar-grade polysilicon may need to grow considerably … [with] power sector decarbonization [requiring the] mobiliz[tion of] large quantities of materials, likely necessitating continued development of existing and new mineral resources.”

The additional demand for materials will require huge increases in production:

For many of the studied materials, demand from clean power generation infrastructure will comprise a considerable proportion of total global production. At the peak pace of a 1.5°C consistent scenario, for instance, silver demand for solar panels might require ~10% of current world production. Future aluminum and copper demand for power sector infrastructure could require ~18% of current production. CuInGaSe (CIGS) thin-film solar could strain supply chains for indium and selenium even if CIGS thin-film is installed at a relatively low percentage of overall future solar PV capacity (2%) consistent with today’s market share. Yearly demand for solar-grade glass and for fiberglass composites used in wind turbine blades could require a fifth to a quarter or more of current annual global flat glass manufacturing and the entirety of glass fibre production [emphasis mine]. For some materials (dysprosium, neodymium, solar-grade polysilicon, tellurium), the peak annual power sector demand over coming decades will considerably exceed current global production rates, requiring large increases in production. Rare earths for wind turbines alone might require tripling global rare earth metal production, while buildout of CdTe thin-film solar could necessitate an even larger increase in global tellurium production. Estimated future solar-grade polysilicon demand will also outstrip current production, potentially by more than a factor of two.

In addition, meeting this demand will force a shift in production, manufacturing, and consumption priorities that will transfer inordinate geopolitical power to countries that dominate the production and refining of these materials, such as China, the report notes.

“Because extraction and/or processing of some critical materials remains highly concentrated in just one or a handful of countries, they have outsized economic and geopolitical importance,” the report states. “Mineral supply chains have been used as political and economic leverage during international disputes in the recent past.”

Nor is the outlook good from an environmental or climate perspective. “Mining, processing, and refining of raw ores is often energy- and emissions-intensive,” the report states. “Mining activities can impact the health of laborers and nearby populations and also destroy or degrade ecosystems.” Meanwhile, the cumulative carbon dioxide emissions from the increased mining and manufacturing activity would be substantial, accounting for up to 9 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions, the report notes.

"Biden and the ESG Community mandating reductions in supply, to meet increasing demands for crude oil products!","Ronald Stein, P.E.","Life Without Oil is NOT AS SIMPLE AS YOU MAY THINK as renewable energy is only intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine as NEITHER wind turbines nor solar panels can manufacture anything for society.

The demand for fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of more than 50,000 jets for the military, commercial, private and the President’s Air Force One, and the more than 50,000 merchant ships that move products throughout the world are also manufactured from the supply of crude oil.

Today, there is a lost reality that the primary usage of crude oil is NOT for the generation of electricity, but to manufacture derivatives and fuels which are the ingredients of everything needed by economies and lifestyles to exist and prosper. Energy realism requires that the legislators, policymakers, media, and the investment community begin to understand the staggering scale of the decarbonization movement.

Pervasive ignorance about crude oil usage and divesting in the oil and gas industry could do irreparable harm to the industry, as well as inflict supply shortages and soaring prices upon consumers for the lesser number of products manufactured from crude oil, to meet the growing demands from society. Constraining crude oil supplies to meet growing demands guarantees shortages and inflation on society.

Looking back less than 200 years, we had a decarbonized society with no coal fired power plants, no natural gas power plants, and the Beverly Hillbillies had not yet discovered oil. It’s easy to see how civilization has benefited from more than 250 leading-edge, hydrocarbon processing licensed refining technologies used by the more than 700 refineries worldwide that service the demands of the eight billion people living on earth with more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products were available to society before 1900.

Escalating climate change pressures are strangling capital flows for oil and gas producers, driving up the price of gasoline, electricity, and home heating. World leaders and the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) movement that are setting policies to rid the world of fossil fuels, have short memories of petrochemical products and human ingenuity being the reasons for the world populating from 1 to 8 billion in less than two hundred years shown clearly in the United Nations graph.

The current fossil fuel infrastructure is less invasive than mining for the exotic minerals and metals required to create the batteries needed to store “green energy”. In developing countries, these mining operations exploit child labor, and are responsible for the most egregious human rights’ violations of vulnerable minority populations. These operations are also directly destroying the planet through environmental degradation. The 2022 Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy, does an excellent job of discussing the lack of transparency to the world of the green movement’s impact upon humanity.

Crude oil is virtually useless, unless it’s manufactured (refineries) into oil derivatives that are the basis of more than 6,000 products in our daily lives that did not exist before the 1900’s, and the fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of more than 50,000 aircraft for military, commercial, private and the President’s Air Force One, and more than 50,000 merchant ships, and the military and space programs.

With today’s technology to work and educate remotely, via virtual connectivity, we should reallocate resources to get people out of the cities and back into rural areas. It’s time to focus on adaptation, conservation, and resource efficiency. Systems need to be re-balanced, natural, and symbiotic, rather than parasitic, and we need to subordinate technology rather than allow it to rule us. Oil is a magic substance when used correctly and burned cleanly, but it can be the death of us all if used poorly.

Climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, between 2030 and 2050, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress. However, efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization’s eight billion, and being mandated to live without oil and the more than 6,000 products and the various fuels manufactured from oil will necessitate lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s and may result in billions, not millions, of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths trying to live without the fossil fuels that are now benefiting society.

Both climate change, and life without oil, may be devastating to the global economy, but which is the lesser of two evils?

Is it Ethical to Purchase a Lithium Battery Powered EV?,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","With numerous State Governor’s having issued executive orders to phase out the purchasing of gasoline driven cars within the next decade or so, and the automobile manufacturers efforts to phase into only manufacturing EV’s here’s some food for thought about the lack of transparency about “Clean Energy Exploitations“.

The top image is an oil well, where 100 percent organic material is pumped out of the ground, taking up around 500 to 1000 square feet. Then it flows in pipelines safely transporting the oil to refineries to be manufactured into usable oil derivatives that are the basis of more than 6,000 products for society, and into transportation fuels needed by the world’s heavy-weight and long-range infrastructures of aviation, merchant ships, cruise ships, and militaries.

The lower image is just one lithium supply mine where entire mountains are eliminated. Each mine usually consists of thirty-five to forty humongous 797 Caterpillar haul trucks along with hundreds of other large equipment. Each 797 uses around half a million gallons of diesel a year. So, with an inventory of just thirty-five the haul trucks alone are using 17.5 million gallons of fuel a year for just one lithium site.

There is virtually non-existing transparency of the environmental degradation and the human rights abuses occurring in developing countries with yellow, brown, and black skinned people. Both human rights abuses and environmental degradation are directly connected to the mining for the exotic minerals and metals that are required to manufacture wind turbines, solar panels, and EV batteries.

Today, a typical EV battery weighs one thousand pounds. It contains twenty-five pounds of lithium, sixty pounds of nickel, 44 pounds of manganese, 30 pounds cobalt, 200 pounds of copper, and 400 pounds of aluminium, steel, and plastic. Inside are over 6,000 individual lithium-ion cells.

It should concern you that all those toxic components come from mining. For instance, to manufacture each EV auto battery, you must process 25,000 pounds of brine for the lithium, 30,000 pounds of ore for the cobalt, 5,000 pounds of ore for the nickel, and 25,000 pounds of ore for copper. All told, you dig up 500,000 pounds of the earth’s crust for just one battery.

The current fossil fuel infrastructure is less invasive than mining for the exotic minerals and metals required to create the batteries needed to store “green energy”. In developing countries, these mining operations exploit child labor, and are responsible for the most egregious human rights’ violations of vulnerable minority populations. These operations are also directly destroying the planet through environmental degradation. The 2022 Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy, does an excellent job of discussing the lack of transparency to the world of the green movement’s impact upon humanity.

How many environmentalists are going to support lithium mines in America? There are two things needed to make the EV technology work for the billions of lightweight cars:

1. Get the mining practices for these exotic minerals and metals to the point that they are acceptable to the environmental movement and stop the environmental degradation and humanity atrocities occurring in developing countries where people are being exploited with yellow, brown, and black skin.

2. Further development of battery technology to somewhat clone how phones have been reduced in “size” with smaller and smaller batteries and increased capabilities in those small phones and reduce the alarming tendency of lithium batteries and their charging sources from spontaneously catching fire without warning.

If You’re Worried About Rising Gas Prices, watch this 11- minute video about why to NOT buy an EV. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-q4nGBHWTI. Since you’ve probably read about EV fires, here’s a site that keeps tabs just on TESLA EV fires https://www.tesla-fire.com/, now at 85 and growing almost daily.

So, the next time you are thinking about purchasing an electric vehicle, or driving your EV car, before congratulating yourselves on saving the environment, remember that it came at a cost of entire mountains in developing countries, thousands of square miles of land and billions of gallons of oil and fuel.

We should all know that an electric vehicle battery does not “make” electricity – it only stores electricity produced elsewhere, primarily by coal, uranium, natural gas-powered plants, and occasionally by intermittent breezes and sunshine. So, to say an EV is a zero-emission vehicle is not at all valid as 80 percent of the electricity generated to charge the batteries is from coal, natural gas, and nuclear.

1. Since twenty percent of the electricity generated in the U.S is from coal-fired plants, it follows that twenty percent of the EVs on the road are coal-powered.

2. Since forty percent of the electricity generated in the U.S is from natural gas, it follows that forty percent of the EVs on the road are natural gas-powered.

3. Since twenty percent of the electricity generated in the U.S is from nuclear, it follows that twenty percent of the EVs on the road are nuclear-powered.

Life Without Oil is NOT AS SIMPLE AS YOU MAY THINK as renewable energy is only intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine as NEITHER wind turbines nor solar panels can manufacture anything for society. Climate change may impact humanity but being mandated to live without the products manufactured from oil will necessitate lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s and could be the greatest threat to civilization’s eight billion residents.

America’s obsession for green electricity to reduce emissions must be ethical and should not thrive off human rights and environmental abuses in the foreign countries providing the exotic minerals and metals to support America’s green passion. Check out the quick 7-minute video interview between Ronald Stein and Rick Amato on “Your America TV” about The Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) movement to divest in fossil fuels, that may be leading society back to the decarbonized world of the 1800’s and before.

So, before your next vehicle purchase, be knowledgeable that most of the exotic minerals and metals to build EV batteries are being mined in developing countries.

EV buyers should be aware that they may be contributing to the pursuit of “blood minerals” to achieve their efforts to go green. If you feel comfortable supporting the environmental degradation and humanity atrocities occurring in those developing countries, then proceed with your purchase.

Persistent Lies about Green Power,H. Sterling Burnett,"When drug companies try to sell you a particular cure for what ails you, the television ads typically consist of 10 seconds of saying how good the drug is and 20 seconds of disclaimers and warnings about possible negative side effects. If only renewable energy companies were that honest!

To my great annoyance and disgust, a power company in Texas promises the state’s electricity users can choose a plan that delivers electricity 24 hours a day powered by the sun. Solar power.

As anyone exercising an ounce of common sense must realize, that is a lie. As sunny as Texas and much of the southwestern United States are, the sun doesn’t shine 24 hours a day anywhere on Earth. That means the electric power you use at night or during cloudy or rainy days is coming from other sources.

It is not until you go to the company’s website or call them that you get to see the disclaimers in the fine print. What they are really selling you is a plan that purchases renewable energy credits equivalent to 24 hour a day of solar. That’s not at all the same as purchasing solar power.

In fact, the credits may be awarded for generation by wind turbines, biofuel production, biomass burning, or even sales of electric vehicles. Or it could be a combination of these. It could even be fraudulent, as past carbon offset credit schemes have so often proven to be.

Numerous scammers have claimed to generate green energy credits but do not actually undertake or complete the projects that are supposed to offset the carbon dioxide emissions and generate the credits. They have bilked taxpayers and investors out of billions of dollars. What homeowner or business buying 24-hour solar would know whether the renewable energy credits are being purchased by the company and reducing emissions?

The only thing we can say for sure about this so-called solar plan is that it is not providing 24-hour-a-day solar. Most of the time the electricity is probably being generated by another source, which in Texas is likely to be natural gas, coal, or nuclear.

Misleading advertising and outright fraud are all too common among companies and politicians promoting green energy schemes. Two of the biggest scams are biofuels and biomass burning for electric power.

Trees are carbon sinks, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for photosynthesis and storing it in their limbs, roots, and trunks. When trees are cut down, they cease to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, and what is left behind after logging, as it decomposes, releases stored CO2 back into the air. Numerous studies show when waste materials or even whole trees are processed to make usable wood pellets for fuel, more CO2 is released. Even more is released when the wood pellets, waste timber, and whole trees are burned to produce power.

Even if new trees are planted, they remove carbon dioxide only slowly over time, as opposed to the immediate release when they are burned. As a result, “[i]t takes decades of regrowth to offset the carbon released in burning before the net addition of carbon to the air even equals the amount released if power plants had just used fossil fuels,” wrote the Los Angeles Times (LAT) a couple of years ago. Meanwhile, even more trees are being harvested for fuel, carbon dioxide sequestration declines, and atmospheric CO2 levels increase.

Burning wood to provide electricity “produces two to three times as much carbon per kilowatt hour as burning coal or natural gas. … To replace just 2% of the world’s fossil fuels with more wood would require doubling the commercial harvest of trees,” concluded the LAT, which would devastate the world’s forest ecosystems and biodiversity while removing a huge carbon sink.

And that’s when the companies keep their promises to plant new trees, maintain the forests, and ensure the trees grow to maturity. The news is even worse when, as detailed in a recent BBC story, the claim of tree planting is itself fraudulent, whether allegedly for biofuel replacement or as a direct carbon dioxide removal/carbon credit scheme. Sometimes money is collected and credits are given but no trees planted. In other cases, the trees are planted in unsuitable locations or are the wrong species for the site, and the trees die. The dead trees then add carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere as they decompose. In the Philippines and India, grand tree planting programs were funded by the sale of carbon dioxide credits, only to have those in charge of the program abandon the “forests” once the saplings were in the ground. In the Philippine case, an audit found 88 percent of the trees failed. I’m not typically a gambling man, but I would wager that 100 percent of the carbon credits were cashed in.

Criminal and civil enforcement of these agreements is almost entirely absent, because no agency with authority exists or no common method for determining the amount of carbon dioxide “removed” is determined in advance for most of these schemes, especially with international programs. As a result, corporations get away with greenwashing on a massive scale, making self-congratulatory claims of being carbon-neutral or moving that way, while emitting the same or even more emissions than they had before grandly taking up the “climate fight.” Often it’s simply hard to account for or track the success of the claims. In other cases, corporations’ assertions of going green consist of nothing more than a series of claims made in a PR campaign. Rarely are these statements investigated and confirmed. In the rare cases where greenwashing is exposed, the common practice is for the companies to issue a mea culpa. They say, in effect, “Okay, you caught us cheating, but we’re serious this time, and we’ll really start to get green now.” Little or no penalty results from these scams—maybe a donation/payoff to a radical green group. Often no concerted, consistent investigation of the follow-through on their new green commitment is undertaken.

As for biofuels, they no longer typically require more energy to produce than they deliver, thanks to technological improvements and increased efficiencies, but it is still doubtful they produce net benefits for the environment or the climate. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency writes,

[B]ecause many biofuel feedstocks require land, water, and other resources, research suggests that biofuel production may give rise to several undesirable effects. Potential drawbacks include changes to land use patterns that may increase GHG emissions, pressure on water resources, air and water pollution, and increased food costs. Depending on the feedstock and production process and time horizon of the analysis, biofuels can emit even more GHGs than some fossil fuels on an energy-equivalent basis. Biofuels also tend to require subsidies and other market interventions to compete economically with fossil fuels, which creates deadweight losses in the economy.

In addition, because the dominant biofuel—ethanol—contains less energy than an equivalent amount of regular gasoline, vehicles’ fuel mileage declines as ethanol is added to the mix. As a result, more fuel is used than would have been consumed without the biofuel.

While the expansion of green energy is not reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions or preventing climate change (as if that were possible), it is wreaking havoc in electric power systems in the United States and abroad. In California, the United States as a whole, India, and elsewhere, dozens of stories have been published in recent months warning of widespread electric power shortages already occurring or looming, as the supply of reliable electric power wanes because dozens of fossil fuel, nuclear, and hydroelectric power plants are being prematurely closed and replaced with wind, solar, and sometimes a small percentage of battery backup.

Wind and solar power are particularly unsuited to supply modern, interconnected power systems because they work only when the weather conditions are just right.

A large-scale power grid consists of two segments: baseload power and peaking power. Baseload power is the minimum amount of energy needed for the grid to function properly while delivering power on demand to every user who needs it during a normal day. The grid requires a fairly consistent flow of power. Coal, nuclear, and to a lesser extent natural gas have, for a century or more, served developed nations’ baseload demand because they operate full-time, with onsite backup to provide power during routine maintenance or breakdowns.

Peaking power is the additional power needed when the system is faced with unusually high demand, such as during the summers in the southern United States, Asia, and India, and during the cold winters in northern states and Scandinavian countries. Natural gas, where available, often serves to provide peaking power because natural gas plants can be built to scale, fuel can usually be delivered as needed, and facilities can be cycled on and off quickly as needed.

Neither wind nor solar can be relied on for either baseload or peaking power. Wind turbines generate power only when the wind blows between certain speeds, and the power they generate fluctuates constantly with wind gusts. Solar provides no power at night or when the cells are covered by snow, ice, or soot, and it provides reduced power on cloudy days and during storms. Except on completely cloudless days with clear skies, the power generated by solar panels fluctuates second-by-second with the passage of clouds.

Both solar and wind require baseload power systems to run constantly at less-than-peak levels, to regulate the flow of fluctuating power delivered to the grid from turbines and solar panels when they are operating and to take up the slack during periods when either or both sources of weather-dependent power shut down.

States in India are restarting previously closed coal-fueled power plants to avoid widespread outages across the country and are opening new coal mines and reopening old ones. In greener-than-thou, blackout-plagued California, the state government warned residents to expect more blackouts this year and beyond. Regulators there are allowing thousands of backup diesel generators to remain on standby and available for use during all-too-common green power shortfalls and emergencies.

Public relations campaigns and activists’ claims to the contrary, green energy isn’t that green, and it certainly isn’t good for consumers.

GROUNDWATER DISCOVERED BENEATH ANTARCTICA’S ICE … IN A BAD MARKET, GREEN TECH TAKES BIGGEST DIVE

GROUNDWATER DISCOVERED BENEATH ANTARCTICA’S ICE

A research team at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego has made the first-ever detection of groundwater beneath an Antarctic ice stream. Scientists had hypothesized areas of Antarctica had groundwater beneath the continent’s millions of tons of ice, but this is the first time research has verified the theory.

The team detected a large subsurface lake by using a geophysical electromagnetic (EM) method called magnetotellurics, which observes variations in Earth’s electric and magnetic fields to measure subsurface resistivity. This research gives a better understanding of the factors that affect how Antarctica might respond to climate change. In particular, groundwater beneath ice streams can affect ice flows on the continent and might influence how ice moves from the interior to the coasts.

Although Scripps has imaged only one ice stream thus far, “there is probably groundwater beneath more Antarctic ice streams,” said study coauthor Helen Amanda Fricker, a Scripps glaciologist and codirector of the Scripps Polar Center.

“It’s been a hypothesis from our understanding of how the planet works that there’s groundwater under Antarctica, but we haven’t been able to measure it before,” said Fricker. “This technique typically hasn’t been used in polar environments. This is a nice demonstration of the power of the technique and how much it can bring to our knowledge of not just Antarctica, but Greenland and other glacier regions, as well.”

In addition to adding to the factors that have to be accounted for in order to obtain a better understanding of how climate change might affect ice loss in Antarctica and its potential contribution to sea level rise, the research team hopes its efforts will contribute to interplanetary research because “[g]roundwater may exist under similar conditions on other planets or moons that are releasing heat from their interiors,” according to Scripps researchers.

IN A BAD MARKET, GREEN TECH TAKES BIGGEST DIVE

“The bio-waste has hit the wind turbine. … That’s clean energy talk for the you-know-what hitting the fan.” writes the Financial Post in reporting renewable energy companies and other green tech firms have been suffering especially steep declines in market value during the recent sustained stock market dive.

The relatively diversified green tech fund Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF has dropped 60 percent from it 2021 peak. And that’s the good news for the fund: “those losses represent an average decline. Riskier stocks on the clean-energy spectrum have lost much more,” the Financial Post reports.

Many green hydrogen companies, those developing fuel-cell technologies, have lost 80 percent of their value. Companies working on EV battery storage, which was already losing them money, have suffered similar declines in their value as the prospect for competitive returns down the road fades. The continuing losses and steeper declines in value are due in part to supply chain problems and higher prices for components.

“For now, the days of cheap money chasing expensive dreams are over,” writes Peter Tertzakian, deputy director of the ARC Energy Research Institute. “Investors will still finance early-stage companies, but they’ll be a lot more discriminating about the quality of the investment opportunity and its valuation.”

Green tech companies are typically riskier than average, with much longer time horizons for returning profits to their owners, which means they may have less venture capital flowing to them in the coming years.

Book Review: Flipping the Energy Debate Script to Pro-Human,Ann Bridges,"If you’re like me, you’ve long tired of arguing about the data inconsistencies, hypocrisy, and insane push to eliminate fossil fuels from our lives. Yet there is no denying the dire consequences of today’s so-called green policies that are crashing economies for no apparent reason other than to justify an arbitrary, self-imposed deadline to transition into a new era of how and where we get our energy.

Fortunately, Alex Epstein’s new book Fossil Future: Why Global Human Flourishing Requires More Oil, Coal, and Natural Gas – Not Less was just released, and not a moment too soon.

Epstein continues his logical approach to the subject of fossil fuels from his first bestselling book and broadens it into a context-based moral framework, bringing new tools to warriors battling extreme climate policies and their backers, politicians, foundations, and non-governmental organizations. Rather than persisting in the losing tactic of yet more data or louder protestations, he instead places the debate squarely on what’s been missing from all the discussions: the net positive impact of humans’ reliance on this most cost-effective energy source in order to continue progress and innovation for already-developed countries, and to support undeveloped countries to reach their potential to thrive, too.

In other words, Epstein checked the premise of the anti-fossil fuel movement and determined it is built solely on an immoral conviction that human impact, and thus human life, is catastrophic for the planet. Epstein decries that agenda as too one-sided to ignore, then redefines the battlefield with his unique perspective.

His answer is our new weapon against cries of environmental activists.

More of a critical thinking “how-to” work than anything else, Epstein first defines the entire knowledge system we rely on—experts, synthesizers, disseminators, and evaluators—and proceeds to show how easily they have become unethically biased, distorted, amplified, and finally revered. Most importantly, he demonstrates that the authorities that the media interviews time and again about energy are fixated on assessing negative human environmental impact as the primary moral goal, nothing more. As we learned too late during the COVID lockdowns, few policymakers or their “green” supporters have given much thought to the economic consequences of their incessant advocacy to eliminate fossil fuels. They simply desire to re-capture what has never existed—a peaceful earthly paradise.

Leaning on his background as a philosopher and obviously influenced by Ayn Rand, Epstein presents a new moral imperative framework for future debates based on human flourishing, instead. He encourages weighing both the pros and the cons equally to determine whether fossil fuels (and humans) improve life or destroy it. Rather than deifying Mother Nature and pretending the natural world is a safe cocoon for all life as long as humans don’t muck it up with pollution and nuclear weapons, Epstein shrugs off this utopian dream and proves that humans have made the planet more livable, safer, cleaner, and more productive through the use of machinery, manufactured and powered by fossil fuels, to deliver ample food, breakthrough technology, life-saving medicines, clean water, and most importantly, the time to research new solutions for our future needs.

Interestingly, Epstein embraces increased CO 2 levels as a positive sign for life forms which require moderate temperatures to survive, as well as a challenge to identify and exploit future energy sources which have the potential to be even more cost-effective than fossil fuels. Until that time, however, he makes a compelling case for increasing our use of oil, coal, and natural gas, with his final chapter dedicated to give you the tools to make your own arguments, one-on-one, to disbelievers in your circle of contacts.

This book is highly relevant today, and indispensable to those willing to wade through the wealth of proof and philosophical underpinnings of Epstein’s research and first-hand experiences debating the anti-fossil fuel crowd for many years. It’s long, thorough, yet without narrative stories to soothe or excess data to numb you. (For those seeking quick answers, I recommend Chapter 3 and Chapter 11.) Epstein makes his case completely and thoroughly, and his passion for the topic and the power of his solutions shine through.","June 8, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/book-review-flipping-the-energy-debate-script-to-pro-human/
Davos Reminds: Other Countries Aren’t Committing Economic Suicide for Climate Change,Seton Motley,"The world’s globalist billionaire “leaders” recently gathered in Davos, Switzerland for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF) – to discuss murdering economics:

“One-third of the roughly 270 WEF panel discussions in Davos will focus on climate change or its effects, with extreme weather, efforts to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and finding new, cleaner sources of energy on the agenda.”

Of course, the world’s globalist billionaire “leaders” are all members of the “Do As I Say – Not As I Do” Club.

Just How Much CO2 Did Woke Elites Spew Flying Private Jets To Davos?:

“Overall, roughly 1,500 private jets flew to and from airports near Davos for the WEF annual meeting in 2019, according to an analysis from Air Charter Service, The Guardian reported at the time. The firm didn’t conduct a similar analysis for this year’s conference, a spokesperson told TheDCNF.”

Get that? When the number of private jets flying in to discuss “climate change” is an embarrassment? Stop counting the private jets.

At Davos, Are Leaders’ Private Jets and Limos Actually Hurting Climate-Change Efforts?

Gee, ya think?

If you still take these globalists seriously – about anything? You’re either not paying attention – or are irretrievably stupid.

In very many WEFs past, lots of countries have made lots of climate change pledges and promises. They then moved on as if they never said anything – and kept doing what they had always been doing.

And as is always the case when people get away with things? These countries are attempting to get away with bigger and more brazen things.

Having faced zero consequences for lying about doing climate change things?

These international climate “pledges” aren’t worth the very many dead trees on which they’re printed. They are nothing but gassy, sound-good soundbites.

Because these countries wish not to commit economic suicide. And I certainly don’t blame them.

But exceedingly awful president Joe Biden is rigorously determined to commit US economic suicide on our behalf.

Biden Commits to Cutting U.S. Emissions in Half by 2030

That means the US economy doesn’t grow – it shrinks by about 50%. In eight years. And as I’m sure you’ve noticed – what with the heinously horrendous economy in which we all are mired? Biden isn’t just saying these things – he’s actually doing them.

“The US imposing a carbon tax on US – will export lots and LOTS of companies and jobs. Taxing them and not US – will do exactly the opposite:

“‘Instead of taxing exports and not imports, we’d be taxing imports and not exports. Instead of reading about corporate inversions and outsourcing, we’d be reading about jobs and firms moving into the U.S. to take advantage of the favorable tax rules here.'”

Don’t write off coal. We need it to ensure power grid reliability,Bernard (Bud) Weinstein,"Weather forecasters predict a long, hot summer for most of the United States, with significant implications for the nation’s electric power grids. For example, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the regulatory authority that oversees grid operations in the U.S. and Canada, recently warned that the entire West and many areas of the Midwest face an “elevated risk” of insufficient electricity supply because of slim reserve margins. The potential shortfall is especially acute in Michigan, where the grid operator plans controlled outages this summer. For the Gulf Coast, NERC deems the risk of insufficient operating reserves to be “high” during peak demand conditions.

How did we get here? In part, looming power shortages can be attributed to a robust domestic economy that rebounded quickly from the COVID-19 induced recession. When production and consumption increase, the demand for electricity grows in tandem. But the main culprit is the “energy transition,” with its emphasis on weaning the power grid off fossil fuels. According to NERC, the premature retirements of baseload generating units, such as coal and nuclear plants, combined with the intermittency of wind and solar as power sources, have seriously impaired grid resiliency and reliability.

In fact, NERC warned as early as 2018 that “an accelerated retirement of coal-fired and nuclear plants could lead to power outages, temporary shortfalls in surplus generation, and transmission problems.”

To make matters worse, the energy-transition has been disrupted by supply-chain problems, inflation, and a federal investigation alleging China’s solar-panel manufacturers are circumventing tariffs. Combined, these factors are slowing the build-out of renewables and new investment in large-scale battery storage.

Since 2007, electricity output from the nation’s fleet of coal plants has fallen by more than 50 percent, displaced mainly by renewables, and now accounts for only 22 percent of utility-scale generation. Forty gigawatts (GWs) of installed coal capacity have been shuttered in recent years, and another 27 GWs are scheduled to go offline by 2025. Greater use of natural gas for power generation, coupled with federal and state subsidies and mandates for renewable energy, has further hastened the demise of coal plants.

Unlike wind turbines and solar panels, coal plants are always on, regardless of the time of day or weather conditions. Coal plants keep months of fuel on site, providing additional security and resiliency to the grid. What’s more, natural gas-fired generation, which supplies about 40 percent of the electrons to the nation’s power grids, has become much more expensive. In recent months, the spot price for natural gas has nearly doubled, while the cost of thermal coal has increased only modestly.

Market failures in pricing bulk power, combined with the Environmental Protection Administration’s (EPA) agenda to accelerate coal plant closures, has put our electric power grids — and our economy — at risk. What’s more, the coal fleet is being pushed aside much faster than reliable alternatives can be incorporated into transmission networks.

Eliminating policies that cause market distortions, such as the huge subsidies to wind and solar projects, would be one way to sustain base-load power generation. But because renewables have strong political support, those subsidies are likely to remain in place. Instead, to keep baseload power in the mix, and to encourage investment in new generation, we need a pricing system that recognizes the value of coal and nuclear facilities in providing grid security and an adequate reserve margin.

To keep our power grids agile and reliable, nuclear, coal, natural gas, solar, wind and hydro all will be required. Unfortunately, the generation mix that has underpinned grid reliability and affordable electricity is currently under threat — a “perfect storm” of market failure and regulatory overreach in place of sound energy policy.

Biden Administration to ‘Transform’ US Food System – ‘Fundamentally’ We Imagine,Seton Motley,"We were more than a little concerned when we saw this….

Secretary Vilsack Announcing USDA Framework to Transform the the Nation’s Food System:

“On Wednesday, June 1, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack will visit Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He will give a speech announcing details of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s framework to transform the nation’s food system.

We should be forgiven our disconcertion. Given the America Last, anti-We the People nature of the Biden Administration and the modern Democrat Party – and their use of the incalculable tentacles of government to attack US and everything productive we do.

The late, great Ronald Reagan once wisely noted:

“The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.'”

Reagan was never subjected to the totalitarian, proactive awfulness that is the modern Democrat Party. Which isn’t even pretending to want to help. Today’s Democrat Party is actively opposed to the country and its people.

The modern Democrat is sometimes even honest about his/her America Last intentions. Then-almost President Barack Obama famously said:

“We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.”

You don’t “fundamentally transform” things you love. You don’t “fundamentally transform” things you like. You “fundamentally transform” things – about which you find almost nothing redeemable.

Speaking of “redeemable”: Here’s Hillary Clinton dismissing many tens of millions of Americans – for having the audacity to disagree with her politics:

“You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic – you name it….Now some of those folks, they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.”

The modern Democrat Party loathes US. About which we’ve been warning for years.

Silence of the power engineers? NERC does nothing,David Wojick,"The North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC for short (rhymes with jerk), recently released a report warning of likely blackouts across much of America this summer.

The report got lots of publicity, including this piece flagged by our own Climate Depot, titled “Report: Deadly Summer Blackouts Inevitable As Renewables Struggle To Replace Reliable Energy”, see here.

My question is, instead of reporting this pending calamity, why is NERC not preventing it? What is not reported, and seems to be little known, is that NERC is a quasi-regulatory federal agency whose mission is to maintain reliability.

NERC issues standards which the electric power industry is supposed to follow. These federal standards are supposed to be enforced by NERC’s regional subsidiaries. Clearly this process has not worked or we would not be facing widespread blackouts. Why not?

By way of background, NERC was originally a Council, not a Corporation. It was formed in 1968 as a voluntary industry body after the massive 1960’s Eastern blackout. It became a corporation when it was “federalized” in 2006. It appears to answer to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the US, but also includes Canada. NERC creates and files Reliability Standards with both countries.

Here is NERC’s mission statement: “The vision for the Electric Reliability Organization Enterprise, which is comprised of NERC and the six Regional Entities, is a highly reliable and secure North American bulk power system. Our mission is to assure the effective and efficient reduction of risks to the reliability and security of the grid.​“

This vision is clearly inconsistent with NERC’s warning that widespread blackouts loom large for America.

Here is what NERC says about its Reliability Standards: “NERC’s Standards program ensures the reliability of the bulk power system by developing quality reliability standards in a timely manner that are effective, clear, consistent and technically sound.”

If the NERC standard program supposedly “ensures the reliability” of the grid then either the standards are wrong or they are not being followed. The NERC report simply does not address this massive issue.

Unreliability is reported to already be getting pretty bad. Sustained outages in the US went from less than 12 in 2000 to over 180 in 2020. The average utility customer went from 8 hours of power failure per year in 2013 to 16 in 2020.

Looking ahead it gets much worse. The Biden Administrations’ stated goal is for the electric power system to produce zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2035, a mere 13 years away. That means shutting down all fossil fueled generation, which presently provides more than half of America’s electricity.

Meeting the incredible Biden target is clearly a great threat to reliability. Given that this goal was announced over a year ago, NERC should already have developed standards to protect reliability during this called for transition. Either that or NERC should say that eliminating fossil fuels in 13 years simply cannot be done reliably.

I find no indication that NERC or any of its Regional Entities is even looking at this staggering scenario. The studies I have seen are limited to around 50% renewables and even these are not leading to standards. They do a huge amount of modeling but apparently nothing on the specific Federal Plan.

Moreover, many utilities are posting generation plans that are clearly unreliable, swapping fossil fueled and nuclear plants for wind and solar with very little of the required storage. For an example see my report: “Dominion’s VCEA Compliance Plan is Disastrously Unreliable.”

NERC should be blowing the whistle on these massively unreliable plans.

Biden himself tasked every Federal Agency with focusing on the Federal Climate Plan. NERC’s role in this is to issue those Reliability Standards needed to protect reliability. NERC is simply ducking this vital responsibility.

NERC is clearly failing to meet its mission. It should be investigated.

Woke Investing Gets Well-Deserved Pushback,H. Sterling Burnett,"The Heartland Institute has been reporting on and critiquing woke corporate elites and government regulators for pushing a “Great Reset” on the U.S. and world economies. The radical idea behind the Great Reset is to make the pursuit of progressive political causes the primary goal of companies and investors. These include fighting climate change and indoctrinating children into Critical Race Theory.

The Heartland Institute has written extensively and testified about the dangers of government agencies mandating banks, companies, and portfolio funds adopt and report on Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards. Heartland has also provided detailed critiques of efforts by a cabal of large, multinational banks and gigantic financial companies to force every business to adopt ESG goals. The woke, billionaire corporate elites who run these corporations do this by threatening to withdraw banking or financial services or by applying pressure through their control over large amounts of a company’s stock.

In a joint effort with likeminded nonprofit organizations, The Heartland Institute’s government relations professionals have pushed back against this by working with legislators in various states to shape and adopt model legislation blocking use of ESG scoring in deciding whether to offer banking and investment services. These efforts have borne fruit. Some states have successfully enacted legislation challenging woke investing. Lawmakers in other states have introduced bills and given hearings at which Heartland staff have testified, though no votes were taken before the legislative clock ran out. The legislative sponsors have committed to reintroducing these bills early in the next session.

Moving to the federal level, 16 states’ governors recently sent a letter to President Joe Biden requesting he withdraw the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposal that would force publicly traded companies to account for and share data on so-called climate change risks and greenhouse gas emissions for themselves and the companies in their supply chains. The governors argue the proposal is unjustified, is outside the SEC’s authority, would harm U.S. business competitiveness, and would reduce returns to investors, including already woefully underfunded public pension funds.

In addition, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) and seven other members of the U.S. House of Representatives have offered a bill to bar the federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) from investing U.S. taxpayer dollars in ESG funds. The No ESG at TSP Act would prohibit the TSP from allowing participants to invest their retirement savings in funds that make investment decisions based on environmental, social, governance, or other political criteria. The pursuit of profits to maximize fund returns, not progressive political goals, should be the focus of federal savings plans, Roy and his colleagues argue.

Though our efforts to derail the woke/Great Reset/ESG/Green New Deal train initially took place under the radar, our successes have recently captured the attention of progressive political and economic elites and their lapdogs in the corporate media. Multiple news outlets such as the Associated Press and The New York Times have published stories in recent weeks and months conveying the same simple but misleading narrative: right-wing groups and politicians are undermining the right of businesses to fight climate change and racial and sexual inequity, and in so doing they are harming American investors, the economy, and the environment, the argument goes.

In a story titled “GOP directs culture war fury toward green investing trend,” AP described the situation as follows:

Republicans are coming out swinging against Wall Street’s growing efforts to consider factors like long-term environmental risk in investment decisions, the latest indication that the GOP is willing to damage its relationship with big business to score culture war points. Many are targeting a concept known as ESG—which stands for environmental, social and governance—a sustainable investment trend sweeping the financial world. Red state officials deride it as politically correct and woke and are trying to stop investors who contract with states from adopting it on any level. … In statehouses, anti-green investing efforts are backed by conservative groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council and the Heartland Institute, a think-tank skeptical of scientific consensus on human-caused climate change that has backed bills that either divest state funds from financial institutions that use ESG or forbid them from using it to score businesses or individuals.

The description of this “investment trend” as “sustainable” is false. Data show businesses guided by the profit motive and diversified investment portfolios generally produce higher returns and do better competitively than businesses driven by political concerns. That includes portfolios that have fossil fuel stocks. Corporations that concentrate on fighting climate change, promoting diversity or amorphous equity, or advancing racial or sexual politics do less well than those that focus on maximizing profits by producing goods and services consumers desire. By hiding this, mainstream media outlets are demonstrating the facts don’t matter to them as long as they are acting “virtuously”: deceiving people in the service of the greater good, defined as progressive leftism.

The fight The Heartland Institute, lawmakers, and other groups are engaged in is not to prevent anybody from making investment decisions based on political reasons. They can already do so, as the proliferation of socially responsible investment funds attests. What we are trying to do is to prevent big government, big banks, and big investment houses from using their political and economic clout to force everyone to support the same political causes or to place liberal politics above maximizing business returns and the fiscal soundness of retirement funds. The AP story quoted one Republican on what he is fighting for in the battle against forced ESG scoring:

“‘I don’t think we’re the party of big business anymore,” West Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore said, according to AP. “We’re the party of people—more specifically, we’re the party of working people. And the problem that we have is with big banks and corporations right now trying to dictate how we’re going to live our lives.”

That sort of turns the common perception of the political parties on its head, doesn’t it? In the woke- corporatism war, Republicans, not Democrats, are the party of the little guy and gal, so to speak, and Democrats, not Republicans, are the party of big business bullies.

Whether it is because our message is having some success or because American investors simply understand the stakes, a recent survey shows most investors agree with The Heartland Institute’s view that companies should be pursuing profits, not political goals. A story in The Daily Caller reports on the responses in a recent survey:

American investors—by an overwhelming margin—want companies they invest in to stop preaching and pursue profits, and they want no part of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) movement, an exclusive Daily Wire/Echelon Insights poll reveals. The poll of over 1,000 investors … showed that Americans want companies they invest in to seek profits instead of promoting political agendas outside of companies’ missions. While 29% of respondents agreed it is a “good thing” for companies to leverage their financial power for political or social means supported by executives, 58%—twice as many—said it is a “bad thing.” “The data are clear: everyday investors want companies to focus on creating shareholder value by delivering excellent products and services to their customers, not on advancing social or political agendas,” said entrepreneur and former pharmaceutical executive Vivek Ramaswamy, … who recently launched an asset management firm meant to compete with BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street with an “excellence capitalism” approach. “Depoliticizing corporate America should not be a left wing or right wing issue,” said Ramaswamy. “It has nothing to do with partisan politics. An apolitical private sector is a requirement for an otherwise divided country to be able to come together. It’s a sort of sanctuary away from politics. Once we lose that, it’s the beginning of the end of the American experiment.”

These are exciting and dangerous times for the U.S. and global economies. It is important to remain vigilant and well-informed. The more one learns about the ESG/Great Reset movement, the better one understands the danger it poses and why we must fight it. I encourage our readers to join in the fight by supporting The Heartland Institute’s efforts. We are fighting for your free choice in the marketplace and a rescue of the U.S. economy.

IMPROVING MODELS INVOLVES USING ONLY THE BEST, FOR NOW … CLIMATE-DRIVEN TREE REPLANTING MAY CREATE WATER CRISES … BECAUSE OF PHYTOPLANKTON, OCEANS CLEAR MORE CO2 THAN ASSUMED

IMPROVING MODELS INVOLVES USING ONLY THE BEST, FOR NOW

Following up on a suggestion made recently in the journal Science, an article in Metamodel suggests that instead of treating all models as if they were equally valid, government agencies, scientists, and the corporate media should rely solely on the simulations produced by the best models, those which most closely reflect actual climate conditions, when making climate projections and shaping policies.

Years of research show not all climate models are created equal. Most of them grossly overstate the amount of warming the Earth has experienced during the current period of rising carbon dioxide emissions, and they overestimate the amount of warming that can reasonably be expected. Ignoring this fact, scientific bodies and government agencies generally use an average of the wide range of climate models in publications and when making pronouncements about science and policy.

Metamodel provides a compelling argument this is the wrong method if the goal is accurate climate science and sound policy. Instead of treating climate models as if all are equal—a democracy of models, so to speak—scientists should use a meritocracy of models, such as by “screening out models whose transient climate response (TCR) lies outside the likely (66% likelihood range) of 1.4C to 2.2C.”

Metamodel suggests limiting the use of climate projections and pronouncements to those made by only the best models as a good stopgap measure until scientists can discover why most models are “running too hot.”

CLIMATE-DRIVEN TREE REPLANTING MAY CREATE WATER CRISES

New research published in the journal Nature suggests planting trees to reduce carbon dioxide and fight climate change may have unintended negative effects, reducing rainfall and critical water availability in vulnerable regions. Critical thought and planning must be applied if these ills are to be avoided.

Coauthored by a team of 10 researchers from universities and research institutes in the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden, and Belgium, the paper notes research shows “large-scale tree-cover expansion has long been known to increase evaporation, leading to reduced local water availability and streamflow.”

The paper applies that knowledge to schemes to plant trees to fight climate change:

Here we calculate how 900 million hectares of global tree restoration would impact evaporation and precipitation using an ensemble of data-driven Budyko models and the UTrack moisture recycling dataset. We show that the combined effects of directly enhanced evaporation and indirectly enhanced precipitation create complex patterns of shifting water availability. Large-scale tree-cover expansion can increase water availability by up to 6% in some regions, while decreasing it by up to 38% in others. There is a divergent impact on large river basins: some rivers could lose 6% of their streamflow due to enhanced evaporation, while for other rivers, the greater evaporation is counterbalanced by more moisture recycling. Several so-called hot spots for forest restoration could lose water, including regions that are already facing water scarcity today.

Based on their results, the researchers recommend reforestation efforts include careful consideration of the potential effects on a region’s rainfall patterns, stream flow, and water availability.

BECAUSE OF PHYTOPLANKTON, OCEANS CLEAR MORE CO2 THAN ASSUMED

Recent research discussed in Eos, the science news journal published by the American Geophysical Union, indicates phytoplankton may be removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and oceans than previously believed.

If this is true, the threats of runaway climate change and ocean acidification are much lower than has been assumed.

The ocean plays a critical role in carbon sequestration. Phytoplankton, which live on the warm, light-filled surface, suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere for food. They also need nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen from colder, heavier, saltier water that upwells into warmer layers. When phytoplankton die, they sink, storing in or near the ocean floor some of the carbon dioxide nutrients they consumed.

The key to this circular process, known as the ocean’s biological carbon pump, is the vertical mixing of the surface and deeper water layers, which occurs through mechanisms such as currents, winds, and tides. Higher ocean temperatures slow the cycling of water from the depths to the surface, so climate models have tended to predict that as the planet warms phytoplankton will cease to thrive, resulting in the ocean storing less carbon dioxide.

Two new studies suggest the climate models are wrong about this, EOS reports. One study found evidence that, like plants, phytoplankton may become more efficient as the ocean warms. The other reported the discovery of a new, widespread ocean microbe species that may be able to sequester carbon dioxide.

“We often view the response of ocean carbon cycling to global warming as an on-off switch, but these results show it’s a dimmer switch and has some flexibility to take care of itself,” said Mike Lomas, a senior research scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine and lead author of the first study, published in Nature Communications.

Lomas and his colleagues analyzed 30 years of data from the Sargasso Sea, where scientists have taken monthly ocean samples since 1988 to examine nutrients, carbon, salinity, temperature, and other properties of ocean water. Even though nutrient cycling has diminished, phytoplankton continue removing CO2 from the atmosphere, the scientists found. They suggest this indicates the distribution of phytoplankton changes in ways that favor species that can thrive with fewer nutrients from the ocean’s depths.

Why We Eat and Breathe,David Wojick,"Spring and summer is the time of growth, with blossoms everywhere we look. Leaves and fruit on the trees, grass in the yard and pastures, vegetables in the garden, crops in the field.

Did you know that all of this lush abundance is almost entirely composed of just two things? These are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. There are tiny bits of other stuff but basically it is all carbon dioxide and water. This is the true miracle of life. Every living thing we see is made from air and water. So are we.

Have you ever wondered why we eat and breathe? Here is how it works, the miracle of life.

We eat and breathe because the cells that make up our body eat and breathe. All cells eat and breathe. Yes, plants inhale and exhale just as we do. They also consume food and water.

Our breathing and eating actually go together. We are part of what is called the carbon cycle, which is the cycle of life. Plants come first, then us.

The plants use sunlight to convert the carbon dioxide and water into big organic molecules. These molecules are circulated to every cell in the plant’s body, where they do two things. If the plant is growing then some become the building materials for that growth. In any case they are also combined with oxygen to release the energy that came from the sun. All living cells need energy to live.

The plants basically eat the carbon dioxide and water, while breathing in the oxygen. When the organic molecules combine with the oxygen to produce energy, the byproduct is carbon dioxide and water, which is then exhaled. We are back where we started so this completes the cycle. Carbon dioxide + water –> life –> carbon dioxide + water.

When we eat the plants, or animals that ate the plants, we join and lengthen the cycle. Our digestive system converts the food molecules into organic molecules that we can use. Then our circulatory blood system distributes these molecules to all of our cells. There are trillions of cells in your body so that is a lot of mouths to feed, as it were.

We also inhale oxygen, which goes to our cells as well. Then just as in the plants, our cells use some of the molecules to grow with and combines some of them with the oxygen to extract the solar energy that the plants originally stored.

When things combine with oxygen it is called oxidation and the product is an oxide. The “di” in carbon dioxide is because it is a carbon atom combined with two oxygen atoms and di means two. This is why carbon dioxide is also called CO2. (Water [H2O] is actually di-hydrogen oxide but we do not call it that.)

Oxidation releases energy. You can see and feel this with fire, which is very fast oxidation. Rust is very slow oxidation so you do not feel the energy coming off. When our cells oxidize carbon and hydrogen it is faster than rust but slower than fire.

The result is water and carbon dioxide which we exhale. And that water and carbon dioxide is again available to feed and power plants, so the cycle is complete.

Where do your carbon atoms come from? Given the carbon cycle, it is fun to wonder where the carbon in your body comes from? There are really two questions here.

First, where was the plant that started the cycle? Given our global trade that can be a lot of places. For example, my kitchen has orange juice from Florida, grapes from California, blue berries from Chile, bananas from Honduras, Coffee from Brazil, etc. I routinely eat this stuff so definitely have some carbon from each. Since I am not growing, it is mostly used for energy, so I get some solar energy from each place. I like that idea a lot.

Second, where did the carbon dioxide come from before these plants ate it? Carbon dioxide circulates globally so it could be from anywhere. Some might have come from the plant’s own exhalation or the plant next door, or from thousands of miles away. Also some might come from fossil fuel use or limestone weathering, making it millions of years old.

Speaking of circulation, the input and output of plants is so great that about a quarter of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is replaced every year. So when people say that our emissions are building up in the atmosphere, that is just wrong. Our emissions from burning fossil fuel may or may not be causing the carbon dioxide to increase, but in no case is that increase composed of a build up of these emissions. Plants eat our emissions.

In conclusion, carbon dioxide is feeding a growing world. More CO2 is a blessing. If you hear someone call carbon dioxide “pollution” just say, “That is our food you are talking about.”

Think about your place in the miraculous carbon cycle and enjoy the carbon dioxide.

Stockholm+50 Attendees Need to Address the Impact on the World Without Fossil Fuels,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The Stockholm+50 in Stockholm, Sweden, will commemorate the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment and celebrate 50 years of failed global environmental action. The meetings on June 2nd and 3rd will follow months of consultations and discussions with individuals, communities, organizations, and governments around the world.

The rise of the Green World Order that will be addressed at the Stockholm+50 needs to address the impact on the world’s 8 billion residents in a future world without fossil fuels as efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization’s eight billion, and may result in billions, not millions, of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths trying to live without the fossil fuels that are benefiting society.

Yes, the climate is changing, as it has been for four billion years, and will continue to change, and yes, there will be fatalities from the coming climate changes. Climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, between 2030 and 2050, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress. However, the irresponsible idea that global warming poses an immediate existential risk for the world, that risk will be small in comparison to a world without fossil fuels, while current governments and corporate leaderships are attempting to revert to its decarbonized status in the early 1800’s and before.

As many world leaders gather in Stockholm the world faces a planetary crisis of pollution and waste, biodiversity loss, and climate changes, as well as other planetary ills that are affecting current and future prosperity and wellbeing. An unhealthy planet threatens human health, prosperity, equality, and peace, but the world also faces the threat of ridding itself from the same fossil fuels that allowed the world to populate from 1 to 8 billion in less than two hundred years.

Life Without Oil is NOT AS SIMPLE AS YOU MAY THINK as renewable energy is only intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine as NEITHER wind turbines nor solar panels can manufacture anything for society. Climate change may impact humanity but being mandated to live without the products manufactured from oil will necessitate lifestyles being mandated back to the horse and buggy days of the 1800’s and could be the greatest threat to civilization’s eight billion residents.

World leaders make no mention that the entire pharmaceutical industry, chemical industry, materials science, energy, transportation, heating, etc. are dependent on the same fossil fuels that they want to rid the world of. Attempting to attain a decarbonized world like the one that existed in the 1800’s and before, could result in Billions of fatalities for the eight billion on earth from disease, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths, versus the projections of millions of fatalities from changes in climate. We cannot continue poisoning the planet in the name of progress just to satisfy our endless electricity demand to fuel the rise of 5G, automated machines, vast datacenters, and digitalization.

Surprisingly, the fossil fuels infrastructure may be less invasive than the mining for exotic minerals and metals in developing countries that are directly destroying the planet through environmental degradation and humanity atrocities being inflicted upon those with yellow, brown, and black skin people. The 2022 Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy. does an excellent job of discussing the lack of transparency to the world of the green movement’s impact on humanity.

Of the three fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil, crude oil is the only one primarily used to manufacture products for society that are the basis of the economy.

Crude oil is virtually useless, unless it’s manufactured (refineries) into oil derivatives that are the basis of more than 6,000 products in our daily lives that did not exist before the 1900’s, and the fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of more than 50,000 jets and more than 50,000 merchant ships, and the military and space program.

The liquid fuels and products produced from the hydrocarbon processing sector aided the advancement of rocket technology, leading humans to break the boundaries of space and place satellites into geosynchronous orbit, significantly evolving the way the world communicates, navigates, and explores not only Earth but the distant cosmos.

Wind turbines and solar panels may be able to generate intermittent electricity, but they cannot manufacture anything. By-the-way, all the products needed to make the parts for vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, planes, ships, medical supplies, tires, asphalt, and fertilizer are made with the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

Everything that needs electricity, from lights, vehicles, iPhones, defibrillators, computers, telecommunications, etc., are all made with the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. There would be nothing to power in a world without fossil fuels!

The need for electricity will decrease over time without crude oil. With no new things to power, and the deterioration of current things made with oil derivatives over the next few decades and centuries, the existing items that need electricity will not have replacement parts and will ultimately become obsolete in the future and the need for electricity will diminish accordingly.

World leaders need to identify an alternative path that focuses on the reduction of certain demands, or identify the replacement or clone for crude oil, to keep today’s societies and economies running, before jumping out of the airplane without a parachute! Concurrently, the world needs to stop building pointless infrastructure and goods for the sake of producing them and refocus on meaningful and appropriate products and technology to support society and economies. Imagine if each human planted one tree, picked up one piece of trash or simply pulled the plug on one human degrading electrical device.

With today’s technology to work and educate remotely via virtual connectivity, we should reallocate resources to get people back out of the cities into the rural areas as well as focus on adaptation, conservation, and resource efficiency. Systems need to be rebalanced back onto natural ones where humans are symbiotic and not parasitic, and we need to subordinate technology back to being our slave and not our master. Oil is a magic substance when used correctly and burned cleanly, but it can be the death of us all if used badly. The world needs to REDUCE not ELIMINATE crude oil and reduce its footprint as much as practical and possible, as that may truly be the only plan that will work to save most of the world’s eight billion residents.

What Might a Climate Change Class Action Lawsuit Look Like?,Christopher Garbacz,"In two previous articles at American Thinker (here and here), I have suggested filing a climate change class action lawsuit to determine if the planet is in danger of total destruction from anthropogenic climate change and to assess dollar damages if the court concludes there is no danger. This essay examines examples of situations that might justify a lawsuit.

Defendants would be the usual suspects in government, universities, foundations, Green non-profits, renewable corporations and their lobbyists, and corporations. Greens have filed such lawsuits against governments for moving too slowly to implement the Green Agenda and against corporations for promoting disinformation about the Green Agenda.

Greens have been unsuccessful with these lawsuits because they cannot prove damages. After all, a computer model from the UN IPCC does not prove damages.

However, it is quite clear that the Green Agenda has damaged and will damage numerous business entities and it’s possible to reach a reasonable estimate of dollar damages.

ExxonMobile, which invests in “green” energy, provides a good example of what a suit could look like. According to ExxonMobile:

ExxonMobile is planning a hydrogen production plant and one of the world’s largest carbon capture and storage projects at its integrated refining and petrochemical site at Baytown, Texas, supporting efforts to reduce emissions from company operations and local industry. … this project can play an important part in achieving America’s lower-emissions aspirations

Reducing up to 30% of CO2 at the plant alone would cost $1 billion or so and that doesn’t consider the company’s other “green” schemes. Pensions & Investments Research Consultants (PIRC), a British proxy adviser, has been urging shareholders to vote against five directors, including ExxonMobile’s chairman, Darren Woods, for wasting money through these Green investments.

Obviously, “achieving America’s lower-emissions aspirations” isn’t needed if the UN IPCC model doesn’t prove future damages from higher “earth temperatures.” Therefore, the investment resources committed to this project and similar past and ongoing projects are unnecessary expenditures and directly harm shareholders.

While the PIRC does not call for vetting the UN IPCC modeling, this would seem to be an excellent opportunity to do so. If ousting the CEO and the directors is not successful, shareholders could go to court and make their case against the Green Agenda. Numerous other corporations could face similar suits.

The Texas electric blackout kerfuffle of February 2021 is another example of another costly, even deadly, Green agenda item:

Nobody yet knew just how widespread the blackouts would become—that they would spread across almost the entire state, leave an unprecedented 11 million Texans freezing in the dark for as long as three days, and result in as many as seven hundred deaths. But neither could the governor, legislators, and regulators who are supposed to oversee the state’s electric grid claim to be surprised. They had been warned repeatedly, by experts and by previous calamities—including a major blackout in 2011—that the grid was uniquely vulnerable to cold weather.

All kinds of excuses have been made for grid failure. Still, backing away from fossil fuel and heavily depending on wind, this never would have happened. How much is a life worth?

The North American Electricity Council (NERC) has warned that rolling blackouts around the country are likely this summer. The reason is that renewables have replaced fossil generation in many states. Renewables only work part of the time so backup power (read: fossil fuel) is required for a reliable electric grid. Too much fossil fuel has already been taken offline because of the Green Agenda to save the planet. This would make for an excellent class action lawsuit as suggested.

Foundations and universities that the left captured can be sued too for essentially misappropriating funding to the Green Agenda cause that is not scientifically proven. Board members could right the ship internally but, if necessary, suits could be filed.

Renewable proponents could be challenged in public service commission hearings around the country. Intervene and provide testimony on the science of the UN IPCC modeling. This has never been done, though it seems so logical to insist on verification.

President Biden admits that his administration wants to destroy fossil fuels and replace them with renewable energy. The only reason to do so is the unfounded claim that the world will be destroyed otherwise. If this reason can be debunked with climate change class action lawsuits, America and the world will greatly benefit. It’s easy to think of many other possibilities for such lawsuits.

How do you turn the Green Agenda on its head? Say “Class action lawsuits will save the planet.”

The ESG Community Lacks an Understanding of What Crude Oil is Used For,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","Today, there is a lost reality that the primary usage of crude oil is NOT for the generation of electricity, but to manufacture derivatives and fuels which are the ingredients of everything needed by economies and lifestyles to exist and prosper. Energy realism requires that the legislators, policymakers, media and the investment community begin to understand the staggering scale of the decarbonization movement.

Of the three fossil fuels, the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) community is unaware that crude oil is not used for electricity. In fact, crude oil is virtually useless, unless it is manufactured (by refineries) into oil derivatives that are the basis of more than 6,000 products in our daily lives that did not exist before the 1900s, and the fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of aircraft, cruise and merchant ships, and the military and space program.

Products from crude oil are the foundation of modern society and few consumers are willing to give up those benefits. Access to inexpensive, abundant and dependable crude oil has been the cornerstone of the Industrial Revolution and humanity’s achievements.

Pervasive ignorance about crude oil usage and divesting in the oil and gas industry could do irreparable harm to the industry, as well as inflict supply shortages and soaring prices upon consumers for the lesser number of products manufactured from crude oil, to meet the growing demands from society.

The renewables of solar and wind for the generation of electricity are unreliable because they are reliant on intermittent breezes and sunshine to work. To achieve continuous uninterruptible electricity, wind and solar need back-up provided by coal, natural gas or nuclear. Further, renewables CANNOT manufacture any of the products derived from crude oil, they can only generate intermittent electricity. In fact, renewables cannot exist without crude oil as all the parts of wind turbines and solar panels are made with oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

Banks and investment giants that are driving today’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels are all the rage on Wall Street these days, to divest in all three fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil, just to reduce emissions. It is appalling that both President Biden and the United Nations support allowing the investment community to collude to reshape economies and our energy infrastructure.

Before divesting in all three fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil, where is the replacement or clone for crude oil, to keep today’s societies and economies running?

Looking back a little more than 100 years, it’s easy to see how civilization has benefited from more than 250 leading-edge, hydrocarbon processing licensed refining technologies used by the more than 700 refineries worldwide that service the demands of the eight billion people living on earth with more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products were available to society before 1900.

Getting off crude oil would reverse much of the progress made over the last few centuries. The inventions of the automobile, airplane and the use of petroleum in the early 1900s led us into the Industrial Revolution and victories in World Wars I and II.

The products from fossil fuels have reduced infant mortality, extended longevity from 40+ to more than 80+, allowed us to move to anywhere in the world via planes, trains, ships and vehicles, and virtually eliminated weather related fatalities.

As ESG progresses, banks and investment giants have short memories of petrochemical products and human ingenuity being the reasons for the world’s population increasing from one to eight billion in less than 200 years. Efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change, and lead the world to an era of guaranteed extreme shortages of fossil fuel products, like we had in the decarbonized world in the 1800s, which may result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition and weather-related deaths trying to live without the more than 6,000 products currently benefiting society.

Efforts toward abandoning fossil fuels will further deprive and/or delay providing nine percent of humanity, or more than 689 million people, in this world that are living below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day, from enjoying the same products that benefit the wealthy and healthy countries. Depriving citizens of the more than 6,000 products that were non-existent before 1900, made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, appears to be immoral and evil as extreme shortages will result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition and weather-related deaths.

Bank boardroom decisions that are allowing the investment community to collude to reshape economies and lifestyles, so that they are in line with the preferences of banks and other financial institutions, is an extremely dangerous precedent. Consumers never voted to give banks this sort of control over our world.

The audacity is overwhelming that those ESG banks and investment giants, in the healthier and wealthier countries, insist that we should limit poor countries’ future access to the products from fossil fuels. Inexpensive, reliable, accessible power, and products from fossil fuels are lifesaving, and one of the best ways out of poverty.

Unintended consequences of the ESG rage ridding the world of crude oil usage would be the restricted supply and resultant inflationary pressures on the limited supply of products and fuels manufactured from crude to meet growing demands that support:

Asphalt for roughly sixty-five million miles of roads in the world.

Tires for the 1.4 billion vehicles in the world.

Fertilizers to feed the eight billion in this world on an increasingly resource-stretched and crowded earth.

Medical supplies that are primarily made from oil derivatives.

Jets that comprise more than 50,000 aircraft for military, commercial, private and the President’s Air Force One.

Merchant ships that comprise more than 53,000 vessels that move products throughout the world.

Vehicles that are mostly made of plastics.

Renewable components of wind turbines and solar panels that are made from oil derivatives.

The domino effects of tinkering with the supply chain of fossil fuels are supply shortages and soaring prices for the consumers, for not only electricity, but for the thousands of products that support the entire medical industry, all branches of the military, airports, electronics, communications, merchant ships, container ships and cruise liners, as well as asphalt for roads, and fertilizers to help feed the world.

It is time for the people to demand anti-ESG bills from their legislatures and put a stop to the banks that are colluding to reshape economies and lifestyles, and inflicting shortages and inflation on consumers.

Power Off? Grid Operators Expect More Outages,H. Sterling Burnett,"The Heartland Institute has repeatedly explained why prematurely shuttering economically viable power plants and replacing them with wind and solar invariably leads to greater profits for utilities and higher prices for ratepayers and taxpayers. Heartland has also repeatedly detailed the environmental harm caused by the switch from coal and other reliable sources to industrial renewables.

The third disastrous consequence of the politically forced and fiscally encouraged switch from coal (and nuclear and gas) to industrial wind, solar, and batteries is the damage it is doing to the nation’s and various states’ electric power grids.

As I pointed out in Climate Change Weekly 389, experience from Europe, California, and, most amazingly to me, my home state of Texas, shows the increasing replacement of reliable coal and nuclear power with industrial renewable power is making the electric grid less reliable. These policies are pressed by virtue-signaling legislators and rent-seeking utilities.

A large-scale power grid consists of two segments: baseload power and peaking power. Baseload power is the minimum amount of energy needed for the grid to function properly while delivering power on demand to every user who needs it during a normal day. For the grid to function, it needs a fairly constant flow of power. Coal, nuclear, and, increasingly, natural gas have satisfied the nation’s baseload demand for the past century. They operate full-time, with onsite backup (usually in the form of diesel boilers) to provide power during routine maintenance or breakdowns.

Peaking power is the additional power needed when the system is faced with unusual amounts of demand, usually in July and August in the South and West when air-conditioner use soars along with summer temperatures, and from December through February during the cold winters in northern states. Natural gas has commonly served to provide peaking power because natural gas plants can be built to scale, fuel can usually be delivered as needed, and facilities can be cycled on and off quickly.

Neither wind nor solar can be relied on for either baseload or peaking power. Wind turbines generate power only when the wind blows between certain speeds, and the power they generate fluctuates constantly with wind gusts. Solar provides no power at night or when the cells are covered by snow, ice, or soot, and it provides less power on cloudy days and during storms. Except on completely cloudless days with clear skies, the power generated by solar panels fluctuates second-by-second with the passage of clouds.

A power system that depends on the weather cooperating is a poor choice, yet it is what dim-bulb politicians in multiple states have mandated. Utilities, when not openly encouraging the shift, are happy to comply because it makes them money: state public utility commissions routinely grant 10 percent or greater returns on capital costs for new construction.

It seems others are finally taking note of the havoc premature coal closures are imposing on the regional power grids. With 80 coal-fired power plants scheduled to close across 14 states in the next six years, multiple media outlets have reported in the past few weeks that grid operators in those states and others are warning policies forcing the replacement of power from reliable coal and nuclear with power from wind and solar facilities threatens grid reliability, producing increasing instances of brownouts, blackouts, and extended power failures.

In a Fox News story on the topic, John Bear—CEO of MISO, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which is responsible for managing the electric power grid across 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba—said he thought the transition was being forced on the power system too quickly.

“I am concerned about it,” Bear told The Wall Street Journal. “As we move forward, we need to know that when you put a solar panel or a wind turbine up, it’s not the same as a thermal resource.”

The chief executives of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and the California Independent System Operator (CISO) shared Bear’s concern.

“We need to make sure that we have sufficient new resources in place and operational before we let some of these retirements go,” said CISO CEO Mark Rothleder. “Otherwise, we are putting ourselves potentially at risk of having insufficient capacity.”

That is already happening. In early May the California Energy Commission, Public Utilities Commission, and California Independent System Operator warned the public should prepare for blackouts this summer. Without substantial improvement to the state’s energy supply and demand imbalance, the state will “have a capacity shortfall of about 1,800 MW, by 2025,” those authorities stated.

Commenting on the tenuous state of America’s electric power grid, Daniel Turner, executive director of Power the Future, told Fox Business state regulators should halt all plans to close coal and nuclear plants prematurely and should consider bringing some previously closed power plants back online.

“Any plans to remove nuclear plants or coal power plants or natural gas plants that are slated to be closed, that has to be completely suspended,” said Turner. “Many coal plants and nuclear plants can come back online. They’ve maybe been turned off and decommissioned, but they haven’t been torn down.”

You are preaching to the choir Mr. Turner, preaching to the choir. Let’s hope the congregation gets a clue.

ELECTRIC VEHICLE FIRES FLARING UP ALL OVER … NATURE, NOT CLIMATE CHANGE, BEHIND ICE SHELF COLLAPSES … BBC LIED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, SAYS WATCHDOG

ELECTRIC VEHICLE FIRES FLARING UP ALL OVER

In early March, Climate Change Weekly‘s lead essay discussed the alarming tendency of electric vehicles (EVs) and their charging sources to catch fire without warning. In recent days, other media outlets have taken notice of this fiery proclivity of electric cars, motorbikes, and buses.

The Western Journal reports Paris, France’s public transit agency, Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens, pulled all 149 of the electric buses in its fleet off the road after two of them spontaneously exploded in the same month while in service. The fires erupted in battery packs on the buses’ roofs. Fortunately, the drivers were able to get themselves and the passengers off the buses before the flames engulfed the passenger compartment and ultimately the entirety of the buses.

A few days later, Western Journal published a story detailing a growing number of cases of battery packs installed to charge homeowners’ EVs, packs located in the residences’ garages, spontaneously catching fire and causing thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to the homes. In another location, a battery-powered scooter spontaneously combusted while charging, setting fire to an apartment complex, the Western Journal reports.

CNBC noted in a report on the growing phenomenon, “There is a particular danger when EVs catch on fire because their lithium-ion batteries are especially flammable,” Western Journal reports. “‘[E]lectric vehicles with lithium-ion batteries burn hotter, faster and require far more water to reach final extinguishment. … And the batteries can re-ignite hours or even days after the fire is initially controlled, leaving salvage yards, repair shops and others at risk,’ CNBC reported.”

In India, where scooters are a popular mode of transportation and delivery, the chief executive of Indian manufacturer Ola Electric issued an official warning that its scooters may spontaneously catch fire. This warning accompanied a recall of 1,400 of its scooters after the Indian government launched an investigation into their safety after battery packs erupted into flames.

When answering questions at an event, Ola chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal said the fires were “very rare and isolated.” However, Aggarwal later reportedly said, “Will there be occurrences in the future? There might be.”

India’s government is also investigating multiple spontaneous fires caused by scooters produced by Ola rivals Okinawa and PureEV.

This is not a good look or ringing endorsement for climate alarm elitists pushing electric vehicles as a replacement for transportation powered by internal combustion engines. When an electric vehicle catches fire in or after an accident, that’s understandable. Cars with internal combustion engines can catch fire in these cases as well. It’s another thing entirely, however, when a car spontaneously catches fire when stuck in rush-hour traffic or when parked on the street, in a garage, or at a public charging station.

NATURE, NOT CLIMATE CHANGE, BEHIND ICE SHELF COLLAPSES

New research translated for Eos, the science news magazine published by the American Geophysical Union, indicated recent large-scale ice shelf collapses in Antarctica were caused largely by a natural weather event that strikes the continent on a fairly regular basis: an atmospheric river.

Climate alarmists among the scientific community, political class, and corporate media have tied almost every large Antarctic ice shelf collapse to human-caused climate change, saying it is a harbinger of a warmer world with dramatically rising sea levels.

If this research is correct, cutting carbon emissions as an indirect way to control ocean and surface temperatures will have no impact on glacier calving in Antarctica.

The researchers found most of the ice shelves and glaciers that collapsed in recent years have been deteriorating for years, if not decades, even those in areas of Antarctica that have been adding ice and snow (such as East Antarctica),. They just needed that final push, which an atmospheric river event provided.

For example, an atmospheric river blasted across the continent just days before the Conger ice shelf collapsed in March 2022. The collapse made headlines because it was the size of Hong Kong. Although the shelf had been disintegrating for years, news outlets almost universally claimed the Conger’s collapse was the result of climate change, quoting scientists inclined to support that claim. However, as Jonathan Wille, a polar climatologist and meteorologist at the Université Grenoble Alpes—who was part of the team that discovered the link between ice shelf collapses and atmospheric river events—said, the Conger “was already on its way to collapse, and it looked like this [atmospheric river event] could have been the final kicker for that.”

In particular, the researchers found 13 of 21 calving events on the Antarctic Peninsula from 2000 through 2020 happened within five days after an atmospheric river event swept the continent or its peninsula. Eos describes it as follows:

Atmospheric rivers occur around the world, but they bring a perfect storm to Antarctica’s fragile peninsula. The storms hold vast amounts of moisture and heat and deliver extreme rain, snow, whipping winds, and unusually warm temperatures, causing melting and fracturing on the ice below. … Atmospheric rivers make landfall on the Antarctic Peninsula about 1 to 5 times per austral summer, and of the 21 calving events identified, an atmospheric river preceded 13 of them within 5 days.

The study found the collapse of Larsen A in 1995 and the calving at Larsen C in July 2017 were both preceded by intense atmospheric river events. The study could not comprehensively examine the impact of atmospheric rivers across all of Antarctica because some regions are difficult to access and monitor due to cloud cover and other localized, persistent weather trends.

The researchers do not state whether climate change is causing atmospheric river events to become more intense or frequent. What the research clearly suggests, in any case, is scientists and climate modelers need a better understanding of, and need to account for the impact of, fast-changing events on ice shelves before linking every major calving event, whether anticipated or unexpected, to climate change.

BBC LIED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, SAYS WATCHDOG

The BBC’s internal watchdog has concluded a BBC Panorama documentary about global warming made significant and false claims about climate change and its effects.

During the program Wild Weather, climate editor Justin Rowlatt claimed deaths worldwide were rising because of extreme weather caused by climate change. This is false, said BBC’s Editorial Complaints Unit (ECU). Data clearly shows deaths due to extreme weather events and non-optimum temperatures have declined markedly during the recent period of modest warming, the EDU stated. Climate Realism has repeatedly reported on this fact, including here, here, and here.

In addition to the lie about an increase in weather-related deaths, the ECU also found Wild Weather falsely claimed Madagascar was on the verge of the first famine caused by climate change, even though “other evidence available prior to broadcast suggested there were additional factors which made a significant contribution to the shortage of food.”

It is noteworthy Wild Weather was broadcast in November 2021, coinciding with the international COP26 climate conference. One could fairly surmise, I believe, the broadcast was intended to put pressure on governments to take further steps to fight climate change at COP 26. Of course, the correction comes months later.

"It’s Climate Catastrophe Du Jour Season, Again!",H. Sterling Burnett,"Like Pandora’s Box, global warming has been blamed for unleashing, or at least worsening, almost every manner of evil in the world—from crime to racism, mental illness to impotency, sports losses to alcoholism, wars to illegal immigration, premature births to incest among polar bears—and beyond. Almost anything one can imagine that is bad in the world, alarmists have claimed, at one time or another, climate change is making it worse.

Whereas cartoon rascal Bart Simpson regularly proclaims “I didn’t do it!”—when, of course, he usually did—climate alarmists shout “Climate change did it!” for almost any troubling trend or harmful event. Despite the lack of evidence linking the two. Or even the existence of a plausible chain of causation that would realistically link a modestly warmer world to the ills for which it is blamed.

As I’ve documented before, even when limiting the claims to extreme weather events or natural disasters—phenomena a region’s climate provably impacts—climate alarmists often blame human-caused warming for producing contradictory or diametrically opposed weather trends or events.

Odd missives and foolish sporadic claims of climate-exacerbated ills aside, there are certain types of events climate change is, like clockwork, claimed every year to be causing or worsening. Most of these occur in the spring and summer. Interestingly, each of these weather-related events have occurred with regularity for millennia. With such regularity, in fact, they have “seasons” named after them. In particular, I’m talking about “allergy season,” “tornado season,” “wildfire season,” and “hurricane season.”

Each of these “seasons” were proclaimed long before purported human-caused climate change was first raised as a possible concern in the late 1980s. Yet now, every spring, when allergies afflict sufferers, a tornado or hurricane strikes, or a wildfire starts, one can expect dozens of headlines and on-air stories attributing the problem to climate change.

It usually begins with “allergy season.” For the past decade or more each spring people have been inundated with stories claiming climate change is causing the allergy season to begin earlier. In fact, this is the one “seasonal” problem which may be fairly linked to climate change. Extended allergy seasons are a result of the earlier onset of spring and lusher plant growth, an important beneficial impact of a warming world. As explored in two recent Climate Realism posts responding to stories published by the Associated Press and in The New Scientist, the longer allergy season is an unfortunate, but manageable, side-effect of the beneficial greening of the earth which is causing trees, plants, grasses, and food crops to grow larger, faster. This greening has contributed to the largest decline in global hunger in history. And the greater plant growth not only removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but the allergy-causing pollen emitted is great for pollinators like bees and birds.

Next up is “tornado season,” typically running from March to early June. You haven’t seen many headlines touting record-setting tornado numbers or severity this year because, with less than a month to go in the season, it has thus far been a below-average year. As I write, only 508 tornadoes of all intensities have been recorded across the continental United States in 2022, compared to 1,200 in a typical year and more than 1,300 in 2021. Indeed, as reported in Climate at a Glance: Tornadoes, the number of tornadoes has been declining for the past 45 years, with the number of strong tornadoes, F3 or higher, falling dramatically. The United States set a record in 2017–18 for the longest period in recorded history without a tornado death, and it set a record for the longest period in history (306 days) without an EF3 or stronger tornado. Even the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) finds no evidence climate change is making tornadoes more prevalent or more powerful, writing, “[t]here is low confidence in observed trends in small spatial-scale phenomena such as tornadoes.”

“Wildfire season” started earlier than usual this year in the desert Southwest. Never ones to let a crisis go to waste, numerous media outlets blamed the early start of the fire season to human-caused climate change, warning it was a harbinger of worse things to come. For instance, on consecutive days in early May, Yahoo News published an article titled, “Climate change is why New Mexico’s wildfire season started early this year,” and Market Watch published one titled, “The Southwest is on fire—climate change is one reason why those wildfires are earlier and more intense.” Both stories and others published recently imply climate change is causing earlier, more intense wildfires in the desert Southwest. Climate Realism responded with data showing these claims are untrue.

Data from New Mexico show this year’s wildfires are hardly unique. From 1996 to 2013, New Mexico experienced 12 wildfires greater than 40 km2 during April in seven different years and nine wildfires started in March in three separate years. In addition, one of Arizona’s largest wildfires in recent decades, the 1996 Lone Fire, began in April.

Data from U.S. National Interagency Fire Center show wildfires in the United States burn approximately 1/4th to 1/5th the amount of acreage annually they did in the 1930s.

What is true of the United States is true for the world in general. For instance, a study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Geophysical Research analyzing global wildfires back to 1901 reported “a notable declining rate of burned area globally.” In addition, NASA satellites have documented a global long-term decline in wildfires. NASA reports satellites have measured a 25 percent decrease in global acreage burned since 2003.

The scientist interviewed in the Market Watch story, Molly Hunter, associate research professor in environment and natural resources at the University of Arizona in Tucson, lists a number of reasons accounting for this year’s early wildfire start, none of which have anything to do with climate change. Hunter says:

This year we also have a lot of fuel to burn. Last summer, in 2021, the Southwest had an exceptional monsoon season that left green hillsides and lots of vegetation. By now the grasses and forbs that established during the monsoon have dried out, leaving a lot of biomass that can carry a fire. Often in the Southwest, our biggest fire years come when we have a wet period followed by a dry period, like the La Niña conditions we’re experiencing now.

Two additional factors cited by Hunter as contributing to Western wildfires in recent years are the spread of invasive grasses—like buffelgrass, red brome, and cheatgrass, which spread quickly and dry out early, providing large amounts of fuel for severe wildfires—and the booming human population.

Environments with invasive grasses are twice as likely to burn as acreage without them.

Tragically, increasingly the spark for wildfires is human action, through intentional arson or thoughtless negligence.

“[S]tates are also seeing more fires caused by human activities, such as fireworks, sparks from vehicles or equipment, and power lines,” Hunter told Market Watch. “More people are moving out into areas that are fire-prone, creating more opportunities for human-caused ignition.”

The U.S. Forest Service estimates up to 85 percent of wildfires in recent decades were not started by lightning strikes or other natural factors, but by human ignition.

In short, climate change is not among the various factors which have resulted in an early, but not unique, onset of the wildfire season.

Then, there is the granddaddy of all seasonal scares: “hurricane season.” This season officially begins in June and runs through November. However, as is true with the other seasonal weather events or impacts discussed above, the occasional hurricane does form outside the official season. Thankfully, no hurricanes have formed in the Atlantic or Pacific in 2022; but, as in past years, when one does, especially if it builds into a major hurricane and makes landfall, one can predict with some degree of confidence corporate media outlets will be all over it, linking it, and every other major landfalling tropical cyclone this year to climate change.

These claims will be false—as they were when alarmists made them in the past. Climate Realism has published more than 110 responses to government and mainstream media reports linking one hurricane or another to human fossil-fuel use.

Data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Hurricane Center (NHC) show hurricanes have become neither more numerous nor more powerful during the past half-century of modest warming.

The EPA’s 2021 report titled “Climate Change Indicators: Tropical Cyclone Activity” states:

Since 1878, about six to seven hurricanes have formed in the North Atlantic every year. Roughly two per year make landfall in the United States. The total number of hurricanes (particularly after being adjusted for improvements in observation methods) and the number reaching the United States do not indicate a clear overall trend since 1878.

The EPA’s conclusion hurricanes have not become more numerous in recent years is unsurprising, because the IPCC’s 2018 interim report came to the same conclusion. And the NHC reports hurricane impacts on the United States are at an all-time low. The United States recently went more than a decade, 2005 through 2017, without experiencing the landfall of a major hurricane measuring Category 3 or higher—the longest such period in recorded history.

How can climate change be making hurricanes more frequent, more powerful, and more deadly, when the data show none of the claims is true? The answer is, it can’t.

So, while you gird yourselves for the onslaught of alarming stories claiming climate change is behind every pollen-induced sneeze, wildfire, tornado, and hurricane in 2022, keep your allergy medicine on hand and your home insurance paid up, and take comfort in the fact that all of these claims are false.

IN THIS ISSUE … Too Hot Models Foul Up Climate Projections … Wind, Solar Struggle With Higher Prices And Material Shortages

TOO HOT MODELS FOUL UP CLIMATE PROJECTIONS

Climate modelers and scientists assessing them are once again acknowledging climate models are running too hot, meaning their projections for future climate change can’t be trusted. A new paper in the peer-reviewed journal Nature points out the “parade of ‘faster than expected’ [temperature rise] results … threaten to undermine the credibility of climate science.”

The paper argues researchers should no longer use the average of all the climate model projections, which includes models that reference Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5), the highest emission scenario ever used, because RCP 8.5 is actually impossible. Using climate models that contain RCP 8.5 results in global temperature projections as much as 0.7°C warmer than an estimate from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for 2100, and much higher than actually recorded temperature trends.

“We need to use a slightly different approach,” comments Zeke Hausfather, lead author of the paper. “We must move away from the naïve idea of model democracy.”

Instead, he and his colleagues call for a model meritocracy, prioritizing results from models simulating rates of warming which most closely correspond to the rates of warming actually recorded by land-based temperature stations, global satellites, weather balloons, and ocean buoys.

Among the agencies that use the flawed averaging of all climate models and assume too great a sensitivity to increases in carbon dioxide emissions are the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the U.S. Department of Energy, the United Kingdom’s Met Office, and Environment and Climate Change Canada.

WIND, SOLAR STRUGGLE WITH HIGHER PRICES AND MATERIAL SHORTAGES

Eversource, the largest energy provider in New England, initiated a review of its offshore wind ventures, which have been endorsed and encouraged by the Biden administration.

The company is undertaking a “strategic review” of its 50 percent stake in multiple joint offshore wind projects with international renewable energy giant Ørsted to determine if the projects still make good business sense. Eversource serves about 4 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. The multi-billion-dollar joint ventures with Ørsted include three offshore wind projects: the South Fork Wind and Sunrise Wind projects off New York’s coast and the Revolution Wind planned for waters off Rhode Island.

Eversource’s review could lead to the sale of all or part of the company’s stake in its partnership with Ørsted.

Eversource touted its joint offshore investments with Ørsted as late as February 11, at a groundbreaking ceremony for the South Fork Wind project in East Hampton, New York. The groundbreaking was attended by U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D).

Despite singing the praises of its offshore wind efforts just three months ago, Eversource is now putting the brakes on. Eversource’s review comes amid difficult times for the wind and solar industries. Commodity prices for elements critical to solar panels and wind turbines have risen faster than the rate of inflation in recent months. This has resulted in materials shortages, project delays, cost overruns, and declining profits for wind and solar developers.

The Daily Caller reports the average price for wind, solar, and battery technologies increased 28.5 percent between 2021 and 2022, while the number of wind and solar project completions fell sharply, by 73 percent, between 2019 and 2021.

Without Fossil Fuels There Is No Need for Electricity,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","America is in a fast pursuit toward achieving President Biden’s stated goal that “we are going to get rid of fossil fuels“ to achieve the Green New Deal’s (GND) pursuit of wind turbines and solar panels to provide electricity to run the world, but WAIT, everything in our materialistic lives and economies cannot exist without crude oil, coal, and natural gas.

Everything that needs electricity, from lights, vehicles, iPhones, defibrillators, computers, telecommunications, etc., are all made with the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

The need for electricity will decrease over time without crude oil. With no new things to power, and the deterioration of current things made with oil derivatives over the next few decades and centuries, the existing items that need electricity will not have replacement parts and will ultimately become obsolete in the future and the need for electricity will diminish accordingly.

The Green New Deal proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and focus on electricity from wind and solar, but why? What will there be to power in the future without fossil fuels?

Rather than list the more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, I will let the readers list what is NOT dependent on oil derivatives that will need electricity. They can begin listing them here ______ ________ _______.

And by the way, crude oil came before electricity. The electricity that came AFTER the discovery of oil, is comprised of components made with those same oil derivatives from crude oil. Thus, getting rid of crude oil, also eliminates our ability to make wind turbines, solar panels, as well as those vehicles intended to be powered by an EV battery.

Today, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels are all the rage with big banks, Wall Street firms, and financial institutions, to divest in all 3 fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil. Both President Biden and the United Nations support allowing banks and investment giants to collude to reshape economies and our energy infrastructure toward JUST electricity from wind and solar.

A reduction in the usage of coal, natural gas, and crude oil would lead us to life as it was without the crude oil infrastructure and those products manufactured from oil that did not exist before 1900, i.e., the decarbonized world that existed in the 1800’s and before when life was hard, and life expectancy was short.

Ridding the world of crude oil would result in less manufactured oil derivatives and lead to a reduction in each of the following :

The 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range merchant ships that are moving products throughout the world.

The 50,000 heavy-weight and long-range jets used by commercial airlines, private usage, and the military.

The number of wind turbines and solar panels as they are made with oil derivatives from crude oil.

The pesticides to control locusts and other pests.

The tires for the billions of vehicles.

The asphalt for the millions of miles of roadways.

The medications and medical equipment.

The vaccines.

The water filtration systems.

The sanitation systems.

The communications systems, including cell phones, computers, iPhones, and iPads.

The number of cruise ships that now move twenty-five million passengers around the world.

The space program.

Before we rid the world of all three fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil, the greenies need to identify the replacement or clone for crude oil, to keep the world’s population of 8 billion fed and healthy, and economies running with the more than 6,000 products now made with manufactured derivatives from crude oil, along with the fuels manufactured from crude oil to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of more than 50,000 jets and more than 50,000 merchant ships, and the military and space programs.

Open government policies should be focused on reducing our usage, via both conservation and improved efficiencies, to REDUCE not ELIMINATE crude oil, and reduce its footprint as much as practical and possible, is truly the only plan that will work.

Wind and solar may be able to generate electricity from breezes and sunshine, but they cannot manufacture anything. Again, what is the need for the Green New Deal’s electricity from breezes and sunshine when you have nothing new to power in the future?

Wakening From the Fog of Peace,Ann Bridges,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should serve as a stark reminder that natural resource competition has both started and influenced wars for centuries. Today’s global crisis highlights that mineral and energy dependence is a major vulnerability to our economy, limits our political influence, and risks our ability to protect our, and our allies’, shores. It is time for policymakers to mount a robust response.

There is a sinister threat looming that has not been addressed: the shortfall of critical minerals used for U.S. national defense and military warfighting readiness. These include the metals gallium, arsenic, tungsten, and antimony – just four of the approximately 30+ critical minerals for which the U.S. is import reliant.

In the fog of peace, America has been lulled into a sense of complacency. Most of these commodities urgently needed for the U.S. economy and national security are imported from communist China and Russia, two U.S. adversaries who have demonstrated they will use resource dominance to promote their interests.

For example, gallium and arsenic together form gallium arsenide – the material needed for manufacturing semiconductors, solar cells, and 5G wireless network components. Think chips – those tiny wafers embedded in just about every machine, vehicle, weapon, and surveillance satellite. Two other metals, tungsten and antimony, are used in making all types of munitions and equipment – think bullets and tanks – without which the U.S. cannot properly field its warfighting capabilities. These four metals have no viable replacement or substitute for their unique properties at this time.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, there has been zero domestic production of tungsten since 2015, and imports to the U.S. are largely from China. Similarly, China and Russia dominate the global antimony market while U.S. domestic mine production of antimony has fallen to zero.

It is time to produce critical minerals domestically, many of which the U.S. has in abundance. America’s bountiful lands have most of the same mineral resources that we are currently importing. Take antimony again, for example, the U.S. has a previously operating antimony mine in central Idaho – known as the Stibnite Mine. During World War II, employees at Stibnite worked non-stop extracting antimony and tungsten to manufacture munitions and military equipment for our troops to ultimately win World War II.

Today, the Stibnite mine site lays dormant, but it still has a world-class antimony resource. A modern plan to restart the mine to produce antimony and gold was proposed by Perpetua Resources back in 2016. The project would significantly reduce our country’s import reliance on China and Russia while restoring the local environment at an abandoned mine site already impacted by 100 years of mining. Antimony is also essential to energy production and storage batteries. Goals we can all agree with and goals which should be viewed by policymakers as a “win-win.”

Despite the project’s merits, it has been waiting for six years for regulatory clearance. This is not a timeline that wins wars or builds economies. Policymakers need to address slow permitting timelines and can do so while upholding rigorous environmental standards. Otherwise, the U.S. will continue to fall behind on the race to develop minerals.

Without reliable supplies of critical minerals, America can neither insulate itself from the impacts of global conflict nor protect our own interests. We may begin to run short of materials that have built and sustained our economic and defense supremacy and those needed for the next wave of critical technology. Quite simply, we cannot be a superpower without modern domestic mining.

Policymakers acknowledge this threat but have yet to respond in a way that will allow for mineral development at a scale that meets the need. Debate and studies won’t help now, not when our import reliance on nations which do not share our interests threatens our republic itself and global stability.

An urgent need to act now to bring our domestic mines to full operation is staring us in the face, but our policymakers in Washington are dithering. When lives and freedom are at stake, the priority of our policymakers must be to become laser-focused on accessing America’s critical minerals for the benefit of its citizens. Otherwise, the U.S. will be enveloped by an even denser fog of war.

China and Russia Rejoice at America’s Quest to Go Green,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","China and Russia are great War historians of WWI and WWII, and know that the countries that controls the minerals, crude oil, and natural gas, controls the world! Biden has done an excellent job of relinquishing “CONTROL” for the “green” materials to China, and relinquishing “CONTROL” of the crude oil to OPEC and Russia! God help America!

How is it possible that America has allowed itself to become so dependent on authoritarian countries like China, Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia over the 30 years since the end of the Cold War? The weaponization of energy by China and Russia have been extensively discussed in the three books co-authored by Ronald Stein and Todd Royal, including the 2022 Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy.

America is in a fast pursuit toward achieving President Biden’s stated goal that “we are going to get rid of fossil fuels. Today, Biden supports and encourage banks and investment giants to collude to reshape economies and energy infrastructure with their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels movement. ESG is an extremely dangerous precedent as the American people never voted to give banks this sort of control over our country.

In addition to relinquishing national security to our dependence on China and Russia, that dependency for the fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of more than 50,000 jets in the world, and more than 50,000 merchant ships circumventing this globe, and the military and space programs, will continue to be the catalyst for shortages and inflation in America.

As the world’s eight billion continues to grow its population, the increasing demands for those oil-based products will face shortages of supply with the obvious impact for Americans being continuous shortages and inflation.

China, the world’s top greenhouse gas polluter ignores climate pledges as it tops the list in building new coal plants. It continues to lead all countries in the domestic development of new coal plants, commissioning more new coal capacity in 2021 than the rest of the world combined. China has just over half the number of coal plants in the world and relies on them to generate about 60 per cent of its electricity.

Due to the Biden administration’s failure in energy leadership, the United States has never looked weaker and vulnerable to China, Russia, and OPEC which are savouring in their growing control of Americas’ energy demands.

The reason much of the European Union became so dependent on Russian oil and natural gas specifically, is green politicians like Angela Merkel of Germany and Boris Johnson of the UK that have done everything in their power to wreck Western extractive industries, with fracking and exploration bans, punitive taxes, onerous environmental processes for drilling new wells and mines, and outlandishly subsidizing electricity generation from breezes and sunshine. Joe Biden is following the actions in Germany and the UK.

America is in the grips of a delusional ideology that makes them incapable of understanding the hard realities of the limitation of just electricity production. Wind and solar cannot manufacture anything, like that manufactured from crude oil.

Green ideology insists we do not need nuclear and that we do not need fracking. It insists that it’s just a matter of will and money to switch to all electricity from breezes and sunshine and that the world’s 8 billion population can survive without the more than 6,000 products in our economy and lifestyles that are dependent on the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

America has known for years that Vladimir Putin of Russia has been incredibly supportive, both verbally and financially, of environmentalist groups and wealthy individual’s efforts to slow or stop crude oil and natural gas exploration and production within the U.S. and European borders.

As reported by the Washington Examiner back in 2018 a Russian funded environmental group gave millions to anti-fracking groups to stop, curtail or severely weaken US fracking of crude oil and natural gas in states like Texas, North Dakota, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Pennsylvania.

For all his fawning over Putin, Donald Trump, back in 2018, defied diplomatic protocol to call out Germany publicly for its dependence on Moscow. “Germany, as far as I’m concerned, is captive to Russia because it’s getting so much of its energy from Russia,” Trump said. This prompted Germany’s then-chancellor, Angela Merkel, who had been widely praised in polite circles for being the last serious leader in the West, to say that her country “can make our own policies and make our own decisions.”

The result has been the worst global energy crisis since 1973, driving prices for electricity and gasoline higher around the world. It is a crisis, fundamentally, of inadequate supply. But the scarcity is entirely manufactured.

Americas’ green goals are incredibly supportive toward China and Russia that continue to benefit in their quest for domination for the supply of fossil fuels, and the exotic minerals and metals needed to support the growing demands of society from the products and fuels that are manufactured from crude oil.

While our current influential energy officials, thought leaders, and research publications believes liquid fuels are dying, the real-world data tells a vastly different story. The graph from the EIA — the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows projected U.S. energy consumption from now until 2050.

The survey of 1,004 likely voters, conducted from April 28 to May 2, 2022, found that 60% favor “a law that would dramatically increase oil and gas drilling in the United States.” Such a policy was favored by 76% of Republicans, 57% of Independents, and even 46% of Democrats—despite the Biden administration’s reticence to allow more domestic oil and gas exploration.

Partisan Split on Environmental Worries

Meanwhile, 52% of likely voters—including 74% of Republicans and 54% of Independents—think President Biden and Congress should focus more on “increasing oil and gas drilling to help reduce energy prices” than “limiting carbon dioxide emissions in an attempt to reduce climate change.” Among Democrats, only 34% favor “increasing oil and gas drilling to help reduce energy prices.”

The poll also found that 71% of likely Democratic voters believe climate change will be catastrophic for humans, plants, and animals within the next 100 years. On the other hand, 63% of likely Republican voters and 53% of Independents think climate change will not be catastrophic within the next 100 years.

Younger Voters Worry Most About Environment

Among younger likely voters, between the ages of 19 and 39, 57% believe that climate change poses a “catastrophic” threat to humanity in the next 100 years. This demographic is also more prone to favor policies that would deter energy production while limiting carbon dioxide emissions, even though 73% of likely voters aged 19 to 39 are “concerned” about rising energy and gas prices.

“When push comes to shove, polls consistently show energy and economic security trump climate change for a majority of the public when asked which is more important. Despite three decades of propagandizing, just 50 percent of those surveyed believe climate change poses a real threat to humans or the environment over the next 100 years.

“By contrast, a strong majority of Americans support government policies that would expand oil and gas production, regardless of climate change. Oil and gas remain, for the foreseeable future, vital to maintaining our present standard of living and lifestyles and to ensure continued economic and national security. This Heartland/Rasmussen poll indicates the public understands that fundamental fact.”

“The results of this poll confirm that Americans have far different priorities than the Biden administration. Americans are worried about being able to afford the fuel that they need to work and live, and they know that our current oil and gas energy infrastructure is insufficient. Despite this, the federal government continues to pursue massively damaging policies that are in direct opposition to Americans’ needs. Our elected officials should take note.”

Correct or Cancel Mom’s Grocery Bag Misinformation,Paul Driessen,"I don’t deliberately avoid organic foods or markets, but I don’t seek them out either. Claims that organic food tastes better or is more nutritious are not supported by evidence and certainly don’t justify the far higher prices. Mostly, I’m put off by assertions that organic food is pesticide-free, safer and more planet-friendly. Those assertions are simply false advertising; deliberate misinformation.

Mom’s Organic Market shopping bags provide an excellent example. They’re emblazoned with six “Bee Informed” messages that help customers Bee the Change, Give Bees a Chance, and Save the Bees from a looming Armageddon attributed to synthetic pesticides. The Bee Misinformed messages merit correction.

The #1 irrigated crop in the US is lawn grass, using over 10 trillion gallons of water per year. Mom’s didn’t say where its number came from; and if this basic information is fishy, what about the other messages? The Natural Resources Defense Council says US lawns consume three trillion gallons per year – not ten. Still, too many people overwater, use fine sprays that let too much water evaporate, and/or water lawns during the hottest hours or days of the week. The better message is, water smarter. Suburban lawns and gardens receive more pesticide applications per acre than agriculture. This may be true, but is it? Can’t Mom’s be more transparent about its sources? Homeowners should use lawn and garden chemicals carefully, responsibly and sparingly – and assume that any chemical (synthetic or organic) may be toxic and dangerous: to bees, other insects, fish, wildlife, pets, children and themselves. A single bee colony can pollinate over 300 million flowers a day. Busy as a bee – sure. But really? A typical hive (colony) has 10,000 to 80,000 worker bees. Assuming 50,000 on average, this means each bee would have to visit 6,000 flowers per day. Perhaps in a sprawling canola field; but otherwise pretty unlikely. Again, what’s Mom’s source? Scientists found bee-killing neonicotinoids in 75% of honey sampled from around the world. Now we’re getting into the nitty-gritty of ongoing organic food and environmentalist campaigns to frighten people (especially moms) into going full-organic and avoiding conventionally grown food.

The scientists are finding parts per billion. 1 ppb is equivalent to 1 second in 33 years – or 50 drops of water in a 50-by-25-by-2-meter Olympic-sized swimming pool: 2 teaspoons in 660,000 gallons.

Used primarily to coat seeds, neonics become part of the plant tissue and target only pests that actually feed on the crops, particularly during early growth stages. They greatly reduce the need for aerial or ground-level spraying with other chemicals that are much more of a threat to bees and other pollinators. They are a far lower risk to honeybees or wild bees than some organic pesticides – or Varroa destructor mites that attach to bees, suppress their immune systems, carry deadly diseases, create pathways for other diseases to enter bee bodies, and can cause well-publicized “colony collapse disorder.”

Neonics may be detected in honey because so much comes from vast canola fields in western Canada, where canola is grown with neonic-coated seeds, and beekeepers place their hives in the fields because bees thrive there and produce delicious honey. Don’t equate detection with danger.

There are traces of 20 different pesticides in the average American’s body. Mom’s could at least post the source for this assertion on its website. More important, these parts per billion are detectable only because modern lab equipment is so sophisticated. The traces are not at levels that should cause concern.

And what about organic pesticides? Organic farmers also use many different pesticides to protect their crops. But Mom’s, Greenpeace, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and the organic food industry don’t look for or talk about traces of organic farming pesticides: in honey, on produce or in human bodies. Perhaps they don’t want people (especially mothers) to know or think about that.

The Risk Monger’s Dirty Dozen List of Toxic Organic Pesticides provides an informative overview of “natural” fungicides and insecticides used on organic farms – including chemicals that are toxic to bees, other insect and wildlife species, and humans.

Among those organic farm chemicals, copper sulfate is highly toxic to bees, deadly to fish, and bio-accumulative in soil and water. Pyrethrin neurotoxin pesticides are also very toxic to bees – and are possible human carcinogens; originally derived from flowers (which is why they can still be classified as organic), they are now manufactured synthetically. Like neonicotinoids, nicotine sulfate is derived from nicotine; it can paralyze bee wings and legs, and is poisonous to humans; it’s dusted or sprayed on crops, so it can impact bees, birds and other non-target organisms.

Other “natural,” “organic” chemicals that are highly toxic to bees include rotenone, spinosad, hydrogen peroxide, azidirachtin (neem oil), citronella oil, and even garlic extract and acetic acid.

If Greenpeace, the EWG or the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) ever spent the time and money to test for these chemicals, they’d undoubtedly find “traces” of “organic” chemicals on “organic” produce.

Roughly 0.1% of pesticides reach their targeted pests, leaving 99.9% to impact the environment. That sounds farfetched because it is, especially for crops grown using neonic-treated seeds so that the pesticide becomes a systemic part of the plant and targets pests that try to eat the crops.

Today’s farmers are far more careful and judicious in how, where and how much they use chemicals to control the insects, viruses, molds and other pests that want to beat you to the foods you enjoy. They also employ a variety of “integrated pest management” techniques – including corn, cotton and other crops that splice Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) genes into the plant structure, to control pests that feed on those crops, thereby reducing the need for hand, tractor or aerial spraying with chemicals.

(Organic farmers often spray live Bt bacteria on crops. But that carries risks that the spray could drift onto nearby plants and beneficial insects. It’s a mystery that EWG doesn’t wax apoplectic about that.)

Those who still harbor concerns might be comforted knowing that the USDA conducts a Pesticide Data Program that’s been ongoing now for three decades. The PDP tests different (conventionally grown) produce every year – and issues a “report card” on how well US and international farmers comply with Environmental Protection Agency rules designed to protect moms and families from (conventional) pesticide-related health issues.

While the annual EWG “Dirty Dozen List” is designed to instill unfounded fears about eating non-organic fruits and vegetables, because of alleged pesticide poisoning – the PDP analyses are scientific and data-driven. (At least it doesn’t blame manmade climate change.) The PDP goal is to ensure that all pesticide residues have fallen to levels that pose no risks to humans by the time they reach supermarkets.

The latest 200-page report provides comforting news for consumers. It’s available here – or you can read plant pathologist Steve Savage’s summary and commentary here and here.

One further issue deserves mention. Not surprisingly, Mom’s bags are made of kraft paper. Plastic bags (we’re told) are petroleum-based and clog landfills. Of course, it’s more complex than that.

I operated bag-making machines during college. Paper and paper-bag-making processes are tree, energy and chemicals-intensive; and heavier, bulkier paper bags take years to break down in landfills. The volume of either is trifling, however, compared to pollution and waste from solar panels and wind turbines.

The bottom line is simple. As the USDA and Risk Monger emphasize, pesticide residues on both conventional and organic fruits and vegetables almost never pose risks to moms, dads, kids, or other planetary creatures. Bee not afraid. Enjoy eating them, because they’re good for you.

And correct or cancel Mom’s misinformation.

Real Threats to Biodiversity and Humanity,Paul Driessen,"References to climate change almost guarantee funding, even for research topics of little interest beyond academia and eco-activists. Polls reveal that most people worry most about energy and food prices, crime, living standards, Putin’s war on Ukraine, and increasing efforts to control their lives.

A recent study by Rutgers University scientists sought to determine how much diversity is required among bee species to sustain wild plant populations. They concluded that ecosystems rely on many bee species to flourish – and “biodiversity is key to sustaining life on Earth,” especially with many species “rapidly going extinct due to climate change and human development.”

US Geological Survey wildlife biologist Sam Droege says wild bees are generally “doing fine.” However, they definitely face challenges, primarily due to habitat loss, disease, and competition from managed honeybees and bumblebees – not to pesticides, since most wild bee species don’t pollinate crops.

That brings us to one of Wokedom’s favorite topics: intersectionality – in this case, actual connections among bees, climate change, habitat losses, and threats to our energy, living standards and freedoms.

Simply put, the gravest threat to wildlife habitats and biodiversity (and to people’s rights, needs and living standards) is not climate change. It is policies and programs created, implemented and imposed in the name of preventing climate change.

Let’s examine habitat and biodiversity threats – without asking whether any climate changes today or in the future are still primarily natural, or are now driven by fossil fuels. Let’s just look at what purported solutions to the alleged “climate crisis” would likely do to the planet and creatures we love. In reality:

The most intensive land use – and thus greatest habitat destruction – is from programs most beloved, advocated and demanded by rabid greens: wind, solar, biofuel and battery energy, and organic farming.

Team Biden is still intent on getting 100% hydrocarbon-free electricity by 2035. It wants to eliminate fossil fuels throughout the US economy by 2050: no coal or natural gas for electricity generation; no gasoline or diesel for vehicles; no natural gas for manufacturing, heating, cooking or other needs.

America’s electricity demand would soar from 2.7 billion megawatt-hours per year (the fossil fuel portion of total US electricity) to almost 7.5 billion MWh by 2050. Substantial additional generation would be required to constantly recharge backup batteries for windless, sunless periods. Corn-based ethanol demand would disappear, but biofuel crops would have to replace petrochemical feed stocks for paints, plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, cell phones, wind turbine blades and countless other products.

This is just for the USA. Extrapolate these demands to the rest of a fossil-fuel-free developed world … to China and India … and to poor countries determined to take their rightful places among Earth’s healthy and prosperous people – and “clean, green” energy requirements become monumental, incomprehensible.

We’re certainly looking at tens of thousands of offshore wind turbines, millions of onshore turbines, billions of photovoltaic solar panels, billions of vehicle and backup battery modules, and tens of thousands of miles of new transmission lines. Hundreds of millions of acres of US farmland, scenic areas and wildlife habitats would be affected – blanketed with enormous industrial facilities, biofuel operations and power lines.

Add in the enormous and unprecedented mining, processing and manufacturing required to make all these energy-inefficient technologies – mostly outside the United States – and the land use, habitat loss and toxic pollution would gravely threaten people, wildlife and planet.

Let’s take a closer look, now just from a US perspective, but knowing these are global concerns.

Solar power. 72,000 high-tech sun-tracking solar panels at Nevada’s sunny Nellis Air Force Base cover 140 acres but generate only 32,000 MWh per year. That’s 33% of rated capacity; 0.0004% of 2050 US electricity needs. Low-tech stationary panels have far lower efficiency and generating capacity, especially in more northern latitudes. Meeting 2050 US electricity needs would require Nevada sunshine and nearly 235,000 Nellis systems on 33,000,000 acres (equal to Alabama).

Triple that acreage for low-tech stationary panels in less sunny areas. For reference, Dominion Energy alone is planning 490 square miles of panels (8 times Washington, DC) just in Virginia, just for Virginia. Then add all the transmission lines.

Wind power. 355 turbines at Indiana’s Fowler Ridge industrial wind facility cover 50,000 acres (120 acres/turbine) and generate electricity just over 25% of the time. Even at just 50 acres per turbine, meeting 2050 US power needs would require 2 million 1.8-MW wind turbines, on 99,000,000 acres (equal to California), if they generate electricity 25% of the year.

But the more turbines (or solar panels) we need, the more we have to put them in sub-optimal areas, where they might work 15% of the year. The more we install, the more they reduce wind flow for the others. And some of the best US wind zones are along the Canada-to-Texas flyway for migrating birds – which would mean massive, unsustainable slaughter of cranes, raptors, other birds and bats.

Go offshore, and even President Biden’s call for 30,000 MW of electricity (2,500 monster 12-MW turbines) wouldn’t meet New York State’s peak summertime electricity needs.

Biofuels and wood pellets. America already grows corn on an area larger than Iowa, to meet current ethanol quotas. Keep-fossil-fuels-in-the-ground lobbyists need to calculate how many acres of soybeans, canola and other biofuel crops would be needed to replace today’s petrochemical feed stocks; how much water, fertilizer, labor and fuel would be needed to grow harvest and process them; and how much acreage would have to be taken from food production or converted from bee and wildlife habitat.

Climate activists also approve of cutting down thousands of acres of North American hardwood forests – nearly 300,000,000 trees per year – and turning them into wood pellets, which are hauled by truck and cargo ship to England’s Drax Power Plant. There they are burned to generate electricity, so that the UK can “meet its renewable fuel targets.” And that’s just one “carbon-neutral” power plant. That’s one year to slash and burn the fuel, and fifty years to regrow replacement trees. This is not green, sustainable energy.

Organic farming. Environmentalists dream of converting all US (and even all global) agriculture to 100% organic. That would further reduce wildlife habitats – dramatically – especially if we are to simultaneously eliminate world hunger … and replace petrochemicals organically.

Organic farms require up to 30% more land to achieve the same yields as conventional agriculture, and most of the land needed to make that happen is now forests, wildflower fields and grasslands. Organic farmers (and consumers) also reject synthetic fertilizers, which means more land would have to be devoted to raising animals for their manure, unless human wastes are used. More lost wildlife habitat.

They reject modern chemical pesticides that prevent billions of tons of food from being eaten or ruined, but utilize toxic copper, sulfur and nicotine-based pesticides. They even reject biotechnology (genetic engineering) that creates crops that are blight-resistant, require less water, permit no-till farming, need fewer pesticide treatments, and bring much higher yields per acre. Translation: even less wildlife habitat

There are alternatives, of course. Government mandates and overseers could require that “average” American families live in 640-square-foot apartments, slash their energy use, ride only bicycles or public transportation, and fly only once every few years. They could also switch us to “no-obesity” diets.

Indeed, “scientists” are again saying we “common folks” could “reduce our carbon footprints” by eating less beef and chicken, and more insect protein, ground-up bugs – or roasted bumblebees. Or we could just reduce the number of “cancerous, parasitic” humans. (Perhaps beginning with wannabe overseers?)

Sportfishing Boats May Suffer From New California Air Resources Board Ruling,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has just amended their proposed regulations regarding commercial passenger harbor craft emission regulations that stood to remove 174 sportfishing and whale watching boats from the sea. CARB is requiring existing boat owners to replace or significantly modify existing engines to Tier 4 diesel technology. Key components of amended rules:

Vessel owners that haven’t upgraded to Tier 3 engines already will be required to do so by January 1, 2025. Lower emission Tier 4 engines with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) are required by 2035, This provides 12-years to comply, as opposed to the requirement starting as early as January 1, 2023.

The Tier 4 engine technology introduces bulky aftertreatment systems to meet the EPA’s heightening emissions requirements. Because of the addition of emission control technologies like diesel particulate filters (DPF), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), these engines cannot always fit into the tight engine compartments of older equipment.

CARB’s proposed regulations to Tier 4 diesel technology threatens to put the family-owned businesses of sportfishing and whale watching boats out of business. The true cost for new vessels is staggering and would require small business owners to triple ticket prices for day trips. Customer would unlikely pay the huge increases to fish or observe marine life and it would end various non-profit programs for at-risk youth and veterans.

CARB’s regulations will require major reconstruction of the boat’s hull to account for added size and mass of modified engines and exhaust systems or the vessel must be removed from service. Also, CARB’s regulations will require the number of passengers to be reduced to offset the added weight and displacement of new and larger engines and emission control systems, resulting in significantly higher ticket prices

A survey of sportfishing boat owners concluded that if the regulations are adopted California’s sportfishing fleet would be non-existent within the next 3-6 years, denying millions of California families and tourists’ access to recreational fishing, whale watching, diving, and ocean educational activities. The analysis also reveals unintended consequences for the state’s economy, fishery and conservation programs and significant declines in fishing participation rates. Hardest hit would be low-income communities

CARB’s drafted regulations for Tier 4 diesel engines to clean up emissions in California’s backyard appears like Newsom’s efforts to continuously decrease in-state crude oil production and rely on foreign suppliers to meet the oil demands of the state. Newsom’s strategy has the state dependent on the maritime sector for importing foreign oil that adds, every year, more than twice the annual GHG emissions than the entire Californian transportation sector!

CARB has failed to understand that the most important fact about today’s environmental movement, and what the 2022 Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy, explores is that the healthy and wealthy countries of the United States of America, Germany, the UK, and Australia representing 6 percent of the world’s population (505 million vs 7.8 billion) could literally shut down, and cease to exist, and the opposite of what you have been told and believe will take place.

Simply put, in these healthy and wealthy countries, every person, animal, or anything that causes emissions to harmfully rise could vanish off the face of the earth; or even die off, and global emissions will still explode in the coming years and decades ahead over the population and economic growth of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam, and Africa.

China (1.4 Billion), India (1.36 billion), Indonesia (270 million), Japan (126 million) and Vietnam (80 million) plan to build more than 600 coal power units, and African countries (1.2 Billion) are planning to build more than 1,250 new coal and gas-fired power plants by 2030.

CARB feels good that they may be saving the health of a few, at the expense of other Californians, while still maintaining their “blinders” toward millions of other fatalities internationally, as California continues to “leak” emissions and air quality responsibilities to developing countries halfway around the world. The same countries that have virtually non-existent environmental regulations nor labor controls to protect the local workers in those developing countries. CARB has shown no concern about the 11 million child fatalities internationally nor all the coal fired plants being built. Eradication of America would still see emissions exploding in developing countries. I hope the members of the CARB can sleep peacefully!

Over 80 percent of sportfishing and whale-watching vessels are made of either fiberglass or wood, according to the Sportfishing Association of California. So, each of those boats would likely need to be decommissioned and replaced with a steel boat, which is simply not feasible for most owners, the Sportfishing Association said in a press release about the proposed CARB regulations.

Boats that do not meet CARB’s standards would have little to no resale value in California, making the financing of a new boat impossible for many. Without feasible financing, many vessel operators will shut down.

Californians spend $1 billion annually to access California’s 174 commercial U.S. Coast Guard inspected sportfishing boats and support local jobs, and nearly 10 percent of California’s marine anglers are out-of-state residents, an additional source of visitor spending for coastal communities.

Higher passenger ticket prices would impact fishing participation rates, and as fishing license sales and revenue decline so would the funding for state fisheries and conservation programs. CARB seems intent on promoting shortages and inflation onto communities of lower economic means that stand to be most impacted by higher passenger ticket prices.

Nowhere in the country has a state proposed regulations that will have the practical effect of destroying offshore fishing and whale watching businesses and threatening the coastal communities that depend on them for tourism and visitor spending. This uniquely California experience will come to an end if CARB’s plans are not rejected.

Public More Concerned about Energy Prices than Supposed Climate Catastrophe,H. Sterling Burnett,"The inflation rate in the United States is the highest it has been in more than 40 years. Many people living today have never experienced the drop in buying power they are now. Historically high and rising energy prices are having a ripple effect throughout the economy, significantly increasing the prices of food and other essential goods and services.

As described in previous issues of Climate Change Weekly and two recent papers by Heartland Institute scholars, rising food and fuel prices are a direct result of President Joe Biden’s climate and energy policies.

To fight climate change, Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline partnership with Canada, imposed a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands and the U.S. outer continental shelf; cancelled oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, foreclosed drilling on more than half of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, and proposed increasing the federal fees and royalties paid by oil and gas producers. Biden also forced new climate-change restrictions on infrastructure projects like pipelines, while simultaneously making it more difficult and expensive to ship natural gas by rail. He also imposed methane emission restrictions making it harder and more expensive to develop, store, and transport oil and natural gas.

A new survey, conducted by the polling firm Rasmussen on behalf of The Heartland Institute, indicates the public largely understands that high prices and shrinking buying power are the result of the Biden administration’s disdain for U.S. oil and gas production and obsession with fighting climate change—and they are ready for a change, both of policy and leadership. (NOTE: The poll will be released publicly on Monday, but Climate Change Weekly readers get a preview.)

Despite nearly three and a half decades of the public being bombarded daily with alarming claims of a pending climate catastrophe, the Rasmussen/Heartland survey finds only 30 percent of voters believe it is “very likely” climate change will be catastrophic for humans, plants, and animals within next century. Unsurprisingly having been raised on the pablum of false climate claims since birth, the youngest cohort of voters are the most concerned about climate change. While the so-called climate crisis may not be ringing many alarm bells among most voters, the survey shows, high energy prices certainly are. Eighty-two percent of voters say they are either “very” or “somewhat concerned” about rising energy and gas prices under the Biden administration. In response, 60 percent of those surveyed, a clear majority, strongly favor or somewhat favor, passing laws to “dramatically increase oil and gas drilling in the United States.” Indeed, by an 18 percentage point margin, survey participants said President Biden and Congress should focus more on “increasing oil and gas drilling to help reduce energy prices” than “limiting carbon dioxide emissions in an attempt to reduce climate change.” Of the various demographic categories surveyed—age, gender, income range, marital status, parental status, and race—only youths 18 to 39 prioritized limiting carbon dioxide emissions over increasing oil and gas production. But even that was a close call with 18-39 year olds favoring carbon cuts over oil and gas increases by 39 to 37 percent, a mere two percentage point difference. This survey reiterates the fact that when push comes to shove, for most people, energy- and-economic security trumps climate change when asked which is more important.

The public’s ranking is astute. Data indicates climate change is not worsening weather conditions, human health, or the environment, and the best research indicates continued modest warming poses, at most, ephemeral threats to future planetary and human well-being. By contrast, oil and gas are—and for the foreseeable future will remain—vital to maintaining Americans’ present standard of living and current lifestyles, and to ensuring our continued economic and national security. In addition, if one is concerned about reducing hunger and poverty around the globe, fossil fuels are also crucial to solving those problems, as well.

President Biden’s and congressional Democrats’ popularity and poll numbers are already upside down, especially on bread and butter issues like the economy that matter to voters most at the moment. Accordingly, if they want to have any chance of maintaining their majority in Congress in the mid-terms, they should take this poll seriously. For too long, Democrats have been led by the radical rump of the party, acting as if “The Squad” represents the majority of the public’s desires on energy and climate issues. They don’t now and never have, which this survey confirms.

As proof, another Rasmussen/Heartland survey, released Thursday, found 55 percent of likely voters had a very or somewhat unfavorable opinion of President Joe Biden, compared to just 42 percent holding a very or somewhat favorable opinion of the him. Sixty-one percent of those surveyed said Biden should not run for President again, and likely voters indicated they would vote for either former President Donald Trump or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Joe Biden if a heads up election were held today.

As my colleague Linnea Lueken stated in a recent press release describing the Rasmussen/Heartland survey results, “this poll confirm that Americans have far different priorities than the Biden administration. Americans are worried about being able to afford the fuel that they need to work and live, and they know that our current oil and gas energy infrastructure is insufficient. … Our elected officials should take note.”

FOR CHINA, COAL REMAINS THE TICKET TO GROWTH … STUDY FINDS SIGNIFICANT EXTREME RAINFALL BIAS … GREEN ENERGY UNSAFE FOR WILDLIFE, SAYS REPORT

FOR CHINA, COAL REMAINS THE TICKET TO GROWTH

China’s Communist Party is betting on coal to boost economic growth.

Economic plans approved at an April 20 meeting of China’s cabinet call for raising coal production by 300 million tons in 2022 alone, equal to 7 percent of the entire output of 2021. And this after China increased coal production 5.7 percent above 2020’s output in 2021.

After repeated failures of wind and solar power in the country in 2020 and 2021 resulted power outages and factory shutdowns, China’s government is bringing more coal online to stabilize power supplies and boost economic growth.

According to NPR, cabinet officials came out of the meeting saying, “[c]oal is important for ‘energy security.'” Simultaneously the Chinese government announced plans to build new coal fueled power plants in order to shore up the power supply.

NPR notes China’s Communist Party has rejected binding greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments despite contributing 26.1 percent of global emissions, more than double the U.S. share.

“This mentality of ensuring energy security has become dominant, trumping carbon neutrality,” said Li Shuo, a senior global policy adviser for Greenpeace commenting on the government’s announcement, according to NPR. “We are moving into a relatively unfavorable time period for climate action in China.”

Also reporting on China’s announcement, Breitbart writes:

China’s state-run Global Times reported on a meeting at which “energy experts” said China spent 2021 “learning a lesson” about inadequate energy supplies and will now unapologetically “push relevant energy projects that have mature conditions and fit the nation’s development needs.” “In particular, the State Council meeting said that China should support coal as a main energy source by improving review and approval mechanisms on coal production and project construction, as well as releasing advanced capacity,” the Global Times added. The State Council also decided China will forge ahead with the “orderly” development of nuclear power, approving six new nuclear power plants.

“Onward and upward with coal,” China is effectively saying.

STUDY FINDS SIGNIFICANT EXTREME RAINFALL BIAS

New research published in the journal Water indicates current climate models are rife with errors because the data sets on which they rely use poor methods to account for extreme rainfall events.

The authors write, “one of the most frequently conducted analyses in the climate change field could be affected by significant errors, due to the use of rainfall data characterized by coarse time-resolution.”

According to the paper, studies accounting for rainfall amounts during extreme rainfall events suffer from poor or coarse data resolution, with regard to both the maximum depth of rainfall and the time period measured.

The researchers examined data from 39 representative meteorological stations spanning central Italy over the past 100 years. Among the problems they found were that changes in recording systems and their location over time have resulted in an underestimation of historical rainfall amounts. If higher rainfall amounts occurred during extreme events in the past than was recorded, then any upward trend attributed to climate change in recent decades would be biased, inaccurately showing a steeper increase in rainfall amounts and trends during extreme events than occurred. The relative amount and rate of rise in rainfall, if any, since warming has become a concern, would be less than previously believed based on accurate data accounting for rainfall on finer scales and time periods.

After mathematically correcting average underestimation errors in the time series data and running various types of commonly used climatic trend tests, they found the coarse spatial and time analysis:

plays a significant role in the analysis of the effects of climatic change on extreme rainfalls. Specifically, the correction … can change the sign of the trend from positive to negative. Therefore, before conducting any trend analysis … from rainfall data characterized by coarse temporal resolution should always be corrected.

If this research is sound, and data accounting methods for extreme rainfall measurements over the past 100 years for other regions around the globe are similarly flawed, claims that rainfall amounts are increasing at a dangerous or unusual rate due to climate change must be reconsidered. As with faulty temperature projections made by climate models, claims of extreme rainfall increases could just be an artifact of models relying on bad data.

GREEN ENERGY UNSAFE FOR WILDLIFE, SAYS REPORT

A new paper published in Royal Society Open Science should serve as a warning for people and groups concerned about the impact of wind and solar industrial facilities on wildlife—birds and bats in particular—especially as governments push ever greater amounts of “renewable power” onto the electric grid to fight climate change.

The team, comprised of 13 researchers from various U.S. government agencies, universities, and research institutes located in different regions, found many bird species are vulnerable to harm and significant population reductions from large industrial wind and solar facilities.

They “assessed the vulnerability of populations for 23 priority bird species killed at wind and solar facilities in California.” Their research suggests 11 of those species, nearly half of the species tracked, “were vulnerable to population-level effects from added fatalities caused by renewables and other sources.

“Effects of renewables extended far beyond the location of energy production to impact bird populations in distant regions across continental migration networks” said the authors. “Populations of species associated with grasslands where turbines were located were most vulnerable to wind. Populations of nocturnal migrant species were most vulnerable to solar…”

Those eleven species “were either highly or moderately vulnerable, experiencing a greater than or equal to 20 percent decline in the population growth rates with the addition of up to either 1,000 or 5,000 fatalities, respectively.”

Commenting on the study, an article in Pipeline reports, “In the United States, anywhere from 140,000 to 328,000 bird fatalities take place per year at monopole turbines, but the real figure is probably much higher because, as the paper acknowledges, the estimate comes from data gathered a decade ago when installed capacity was only 57 percent of the current figure. Solar energy generation back then, when capacity was only 37 percent of the current figure, caused up to 138,600 birth deaths in the country…”

This research confirms what other reports have found: the government backed push to impose ever greater use of renewable energy sources onto the grid should concern anyone concerned about intact wild ecosystems and the variety of species that inhabit or migrate through them, especially, but not solely, birds and other avian species.

How Many of the World’s 8 Billion Will Survive Without Fossil Fuels?,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The economic and technological advances over the last 200 years have transformed how we produce and consume energy. From the 1800’s, the fossil fuels of coal, oil, and natural gas now support more than 80 percent of the world’s energy supply to meet the world’s population demands for more than 6,000 products in our daily lives, made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of crude oil, that did not exist before the 1900’s, and the fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of more than 50,000 jets and more than 50,000 merchant ships, and the military and space programs. To the left is a pictorial history of these energy transitions over the years.

Recent outlooks published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Energy Information Administration (EIA) paint a clear picture that global energy needs are going to rise significantly in the decades to come, reflecting population growth, more nations progressing out of poverty, and the expansion of transportation and technology systems worldwide. Products derived from crude oil will continue to satisfy a significant share of this growing demand.

As expected, during the recent Earth Day celebration, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jane Fonda, Matt Damon and more of the biggest celebrities leading the charge on climate change were demanding the elimination of crude oil from society. One would think that those movie stars have the intelligence to know that crude oil is virtually useless unless it is manufactured into something usable, to meet their personal demands and the demands of society, via refineries. The hydrocarbon processing industry, i.e., those refineries, have a rich history of discovery, challenges, breakthroughs, trial and error, collaboration, and success.

Looking back a little more than 100 years, it’s easy to see how civilization has benefited from more than 250 leading-edge, hydrocarbon processing licensed refining technologies used by the more than 700 refineries worldwide that supply oil products to meet the demands of the 8 billion living on earth with more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products and subsequent infrastructures were available to society before 1900.

Wind turbines and solar panels may be able to generate intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine, but they cannot manufacture anything. By the way, all the products needed to make the parts for vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, planes, ships, medical supplies, tires, asphalt, and fertilizer are made with the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. Getting rid of crude oil will eliminate virtually everything in our daily lives and economies.

After coal, oil, and natural gas, we created various modes of transportation, a medical industry, and electronics and communications systems. Oil reduced infant mortality, extended life longevity from 40+ to more than 80+, and gave the public the ability to move anywhere in the world via planes, trains, ships, and vehicles, and virtually eliminated deaths from most diseases and from all forms of weather, All of that apparent “progress” can all be attributable to the introduction of coal, oil, and natural gas into society.

World leaders and the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) movement that are setting policies to rid the world of fossil fuels, have short memories of petrochemical products and human ingenuity being the reasons for the world populating from 1 to 8 billion in less than two hundred years shown clearly in the United Nations graph below.

The climate is changing, as it has been for 4 billion years, and will continue to change, and yes, there will be fatalities from the coming climate changes, but those fatalities will be small in comparison to a world without fossil fuels, that revert to its decarbonized status in the early 1800’s and before.

Climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, between 2030 and 2050, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress, but efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization’s eight billion, and may result in billions, not millions, of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths trying to live without the fossil fuels that are benefiting society.

Just a few hundred years ago, before oil, the world was unspoiled, decarbonized, and dominated by mother nature and the wild animal kingdom. There was no coal fired power plants, nor natural gas power plants, and the Beverly Hillbillies had not yet discovered oil. There were fewer humans competing with the animals due to humanity’s limited ability to survive what mother nature provided. Before oil, life was hard and dirty, with many weather and disease related deaths.

There are now eight billion of us, with most people living much longer and more prosperous lives than the one billion people who were around when fossil fuels use took off after the mid 1800’s. Moreover, the richer we are, the greener most parts of the planet become.

Pundits and future historians will debate the effect of longer lifespans for decades to come. The world population has increased dramatically after the introduction of fossil fuels and the populations has become dependent on that same fossil fuels to feed the world by transporting food and products worldwide to feed those eight billion on this increasingly resource-stretched and crowded earth.

To comprehend the “pristine” world before the introduction of oil, we can easily observe the world’s poorest countries to see what lifestyles are like with just mother nature and the animal kingdom to contend with. Those developing countries are living in a decarbonized environment and have yet to enter an industrialized revolution.

Today, to continue to support the eight billion on earth, we need the more than 53,000 merchant ships that move those 6,000 products throughout the world, and the 50,000 jets that now move four billion people around the world.

With no backup plan for a replacement for the products manufactured from oil, the Leonardo DiCaprio, Jane Fonda, Matt Damon, and President Joe Biden’s efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change. Ridding the world of fossil fuels, could result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths. Imagine the cold, misery, and loss of life under a scenario where today’s eight billion try to live in the decarbonized world in the early 1800’s without today’s products and transportation fuels?

Climate Alarmism Posing as Science Education for Children,David Wojick,"The new and so-called Next Generation Science Standards are now law for about a third of American children. They say what will be taught in each grade from first grade through high school. At least 20 states have adopted them. See https://ngss.nsta.org/About.aspx for a map.

Traditional standards still govern in the other States. These generally mandate that climate science will be taught in high school Earth Science courses. Earth Science is an optional course, not a requirement, and even then climate is a minor topic.

In stark contrast the Next Gen standards are alarmist to the core. They mandate that climate be taught in middle school science, which everyone takes. The topic is emphasized, with alarmism a central feature. This means lots of climate modeling, even though these students have had relatively little prior science. They cannot possibly evaluate the models they are forced to use.

Implementing Next Gen requires developing lesson plans that say what will be taught in each one hour class, often including how it will be taught. Writing these lesson plans for every topic, in every grade, is a huge ongoing effort.

Next Gen has just approved a big climate science unit and it is very bad. It starts with newspaper accounts of floods and droughts, blames them on our CO2 and methane emissions, then ends with community action. And this is for 7th graders, who are typically around 13 years old and know very little hard science. This is pure alarmism presented to children as science. It is purely shameful.

The developer is OpenSciEd, where open means their products are free for schools to use. Who pays is an interesting question.

The title is “OpenSciEd Unit 7.6: How Do Changes in Earth’s System Impact Our Communities and What Can We Do About It?” Get it? Changes cause impact requiring community action. The standard alarmist formula, action not science.

You can find the junk here: https://www.openscied.org/instructional-materials/7-6-earths-resources-human-impact/

They even have a neat trick in their advertising. They claim the students “figure out” all this alarmism, saying this:

“This unit on Earth’s resources and human impact begins with students observing news stories and headlines of drought and flood events across the United States. Students figure out that these drought and flood events are not normal and that both kinds of events seem to be related to rising temperatures.”

“Students figure out that the rising temperatures are caused by an imbalance in Earth’s carbon system, resulting in a variety of problems in different communities. The unit ends with students evaluating different kinds of solutions to these problems and how they are implemented in communities.”

A lot of student figuring, right? They must think a lot. Wrong! This is pure indoctrination.

Here is the list of the lessons, which makes it crystal clear that they are being told what we supposedly “know”, which is just alarmist doctrine.

“Lesson 1: Why are floods and droughts happening more often?

Lesson 2: What would we normally expect for these places and how do we know it’s really changing?

Lesson 3: How would increased temperatures affect evaporation?

Lesson 4: Are rising temperatures affecting anything else in Earth’s water system?

Lesson 5: How are rising temperatures changing water stories in these communities?

Lesson 6: How are rising temperatures connected to two seemingly different phenomena?

Lesson 7: Are there any changes in the air that could be related to rising temperatures?

Lesson 8: Are changes in carbon dioxide and methane related to or causing temperatures to increase?

Lesson 9: Are the changes in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere part of normal cycles that Earth goes through?

Lesson 10: What is happening in the world to cause the sharp rise in CO2?

Lesson 11: Why could burning fossil fuels create a problem for CO2 in the atmosphere?

Lesson 12: How are changes to Earth’s carbon system impacting Earth’s water system?

Lesson 13: Why is solving the climate change problem so challenging?

Lesson 14: What things can people do to reduce carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere?

Lesson 15: How can large-scale solutions work to reduce carbon in the atmosphere?

Lesson 16: How are these solutions working in our communities?

Lesson 17: What solutions work best for our school or community?

Lesson 18: What can we explain now, and what questions do we still have?”

I like the last one about remaining questions. The only uncertainty climate alarmism admits to is “How bad will it be?” And it is always worse than we thought.

This piece of alarmist junk even won a merit badge! The Next Generation Science Standards thought-controllers give it a “Design Badge” for excellence. They even praise it in detail. You can read that here: https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/middle-school-openscied-unit-76-how-do-changes-earth’s-system-impact-our-communities-and

Conclusion: The Next Generation Science Standards are a national disgrace. These lessons are pure alarmist hype plus activism presented as science to children.

However this activist lesson plan is not mandated. Its use is up to the states and/or school districts. Thus the big fight lies ahead.

We must fight to keep this alarmist non-science out of the 7th grade classroom. Our children deserve real science.

Will California Buyers be Mandated to Purchase the Forthcoming Oversupply of EV’s?,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","A year and a half after California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035, the state is rolling out a roadmap to help it get there, but average citizens may show they are not about to be mandated by Newsom to make drastic lifestyle changes.

A new rule proposed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the state agency that regulates air pollution, would require the share of zero-emission vehicles sold in the state to nearly triple by 2026 — rising from 12 percent of all sales today to 35 percent. The rule, which lays out the country’s first roadmap to phase out gas-powered vehicles, calls for all new vehicles to be fully electric, hydrogen powered, or plug-in hybrids by 2035. That’s a sharp increase from 2021, when about 12 percent of all cars sold in the state were zero-emission, according to the air board. About 1 million of the 26 million cars currently on California roads are zero-emission.

Newsom is mandating a lifestyle change to EV ownership onto the traditional middle and working classes and those on fixed incomes that may not want or afford an EV. He and the state may face political and legal repercussions as the date approaches when the average citizen will be unable to purchase a gasoline fueled vehicle in California.

Amid tougher emissions regulations worldwide, established automakers are racing to add more EVs to their lineup. A Reuters analysis found that global automakers such as Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Fiat, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Daimler, and Chrysler plan to spend a combined U.S. $300 billion on EVs over the next decade as car companies are betting big on EV’s. Most of the EV’s will be manufactured in foreign countries far removed from American ports.

China came from zero production in 1950, to 2019 where it now produces more cars than the USA, Japan, and India collectively. The 6-minute video of the automobile manufacturing “needle” shows how the foreign manufacturing dominance occurred over that 69-year period.

Even with the great California year-round weather, the states’ EV user’s experiences do not bode well for projected EV sales in America as the states’ EV users may be sending a caution-to-the-wind (no pun intended) message to America that the EV usage in the state reflects very conservative notices to future EV owners. A few reasons why Californians may be sending the wrong message to America is the profile of current EV owners:

1. The EV owners represent multi-car families. Thus, the limited usage of the EV’s of about 5,000 miles per year is a reflection that the EV is a second vehicle, for those that can afford a second vehicle, and not the family workhorse vehicle.

2. The primary owners of EV’s are the highly educated and financially well off, and not representative of the majority that are middle to low income folks, or those on fixed incomes. The California challenge is that more than 18 million (45 percent of the 40 million Californians) represent the Hispanic and African American populations of the state, and the more than two million undocumented immigrants.

3. EV owner incomes rank among the highest in the country which may be a reflection of home owners that have easier access to charging their EV from their multi-car garages, or for those folks living in new apartments that may have access to more convenient EV charging capabilities. Most car owners are not homeowners and park in the street.

The reasons why EVs aren’t grabbing consumers by the tailpipe are many, but the main ones are affordability, charging and range functionality, and the possible exposure to inclement weather.

Another challenge for the EV growth is the EV charging dependence on intermittent electricity generated from breezes and sunshine. Adding EV charging loads onto the grid that is becoming more unstable is like putting salt in the wound. Power outages are now commonplace in California and Texas with more to follow throughout the nation as we adjust to a life dependent upon the time of day and the weather.

Until the current elite owners can demonstrate to the middle-income and those on fixed incomes that their EV’s are their primary family workhorse vehicles in all kinds of weather conditions, the less fortunate will most likely remain reluctant to buy into the EV evolution. Growing the supply chain for EV’s without a corresponding growth in demand could be an economic disaster in the works.

Likewise, growing the supply chain in foreign countries for EV’s without a corresponding growth in demand, or an effective way to transport via cargo ships those vehicles built in countries far removed from American ports, could also be an economic catastrophe.

The current EV ownership profiles of the oligarchic elite that are highly educated, highly compensated, multi-car families, with low mileage requirements for the families second car, are dramatically different from most vehicle owners that are single-car owners. Mandating a change to EV ownership and forced austerity may face a rebellion from those that need transportation.

MEDIA ADVISORY: Climate at a Glance for Teachers and Students Released by The Heartland Institute,"James Taylor, H. Sterling Burnett, Anthony Watts","Available for Purchase Today on Amazon.com

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (April 22, 2022) – In today’s world of 24/7 media saturation, it is difficult to look beyond headlines to find the real facts when it comes to climate change issues, some of which are very complex. Climate at a Glance for Teachers and Students: Facts on 30 Prominent Climate Topics – available on Amazon.com for the first time on Earth Day – presents these complex topics in an easy-to-digest form that can prompt further study.

Published by The Heartland Institute, the 2022 edition of the book breaks down 30 of the most frequently argued climate issues into short, “at-a-glance” summaries that provide, accurate, critical information concerning climate change. Topics include the latest data and analysis of the climate’s effect on crop production, drought, floods, coral reefs, sea-level rise, ice melt, extreme weather, the urban heat-island effect, wildfires, polar bears, the effect of COVID-19 on carbon dioxide levels, and more.

“Each topic has key takeaways, and is cited and referenced, often using U.S. government data from NOAA, NASA, EPA and other agencies to cut through the clutter and show the reality of each climate topic,” said Heartland Institute Senior fellow Anthony Watts, one of the book’s co-authors, and a meteorologist for decades for television and radio news stations. “After spending decades on-camera during the evening TV news presenting meteorological events and trying to explain them in a way that a layperson can understand, I applied that experience to the production of this book.

“Simple, easy-to-digest explanations, factual references, and compelling graphics allow for easy reading of what are often complex climate topics,” Watts said.

The hardcopy of the book contains links and a scannable QR-code to freely downloadable and distributable digital PDF copies of the book, as well as a PowerPoint slide deck for all the topics.

Co-author and Heartland Institute President James Taylor, who has studied, debated, and written about environmental and energy issues for nearly 20 years, says this book is an essential resource for teachers, students, and parents to counter the one-sided and alarmist climate instruction in most public schools today.

“The environmental left has done everything in its power to monopolize climate messaging and prevent students from learning the truth about asserted climate change,” Taylor said. “Climate at a Glance for Teachers and Students shows that scientific truth will always win out over agenda-driven propaganda.”

A free digital (PDF) copy of Climate at a Glance for Teachers and Students can be found at this link.

H. Sterling Burnett, director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environment Policy at The Heartland Institute, edited Watts’ and Taylor’s work. The book presents facts without the “hyperbolic statements of doom” common in academia and popular culture.

“If teachers are going to discuss climate change in their classrooms, the discussions should be grounded in an accurate representation of the science,” Burnett said. “Climate at a Glance provides this in a form easily accessible for teachers and students alike. Without frills or hyperbolic statements of doom, using verifiable data for topic after topic, Climate at a Glance demonstrates there is no climate crisis.”

The Heartland Institute, a free-market think tank founded in 1984, is one of the world’s leading organizations promoting the work of scientists who are skeptical that human activity is causing a climate crisis.

Heartland has hosted 14 International Conferences on Climate Change attended by thousands since 2008, published the six-volume Climate Change Reconsidered series by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, and for 21 years has published Environment and Climate News. Heartland has also published several popular books on the climate, including Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming (2015), Seven Theories of Climate Change (2010), and Is the U.S. Surface Temperature Record Reliable? (2009).

"‘State of the Planet’ Is Good, No Climate Crisis in Sight",H. Sterling Burnett,"For nearly two years now, Climate at a Glance and Climate Change Weekly have detailed the copious amounts of data and evidence that clearly demonstrate the Earth is not facing a climate crisis. (A new, print version of Climate at a Glance was published on Earth Day.)

Over the course of hundreds of reports and articles, many responding to alarming and false climate stories hyped in the corporate media, these sites have presented real-world data showing fewer people are losing their lives to extreme weather events and nonoptimal temperatures than ever before; hunger, malnutrition, and deaths from starvation have fallen more and faster than at any previous time in history, thanks primarily to record-setting crop growth assisted by increased carbon dioxide; and the lack of evidence that most types of extreme weather—hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, drought, etc.—have become more frequent or more intense because of human fossil fuel use.

The Heartland Institute and its associated researchers are hardly the only organization and group of scholars hammering this point home on a regular basis. Across the pond, in the United Kingdom, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) has for years been doing yeoman’s work to bring the unalarming truth about present climate conditions to light.

Most recently, GWPF published its annual State of the Climate report, by Ole Humlum, Ph.D., emeritus professor at the University of Oslo. In this report, Humlum examined temperature records and trends for the atmosphere and oceans and for weather events. Humlum finds, among other things, there is no evidence of a dramatic change in snow cover, rates of sea level rise, or storm activity.

Some facts from Humlum’s report:

Global tide gauge measurements suggest sea levels are rising on average between 1 and 2 mm per year, consistent with the historic rise of the past few hundred years, with no recent acceleration or deceleration in the rate of rise.

Average snow cover for the Northern Hemisphere has been stable since the onset of satellite observations in 1979. Autumn snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has been slightly increasing, the midwinter cover has remained virtually unchanged in extent, and spring snow cover displays a slight decreasing trend.

The most recent data on global tropical storms and hurricanes show accumulated cyclone energy is well within the range observed since 1970 and the number of hurricanes making landfall in the continental United States remains within the normal range for the entire observation period since 1851.

Humlum’s report provides much detail about how temperatures are measured on land and oceans, the problems with each of the measuring systems, why there is a discrepancy between the ground-based temperature measurements and satellite measurements, and the hows and whys of temperature trends and how they differ by latitude, altitude, ocean depth, and region and zone. Humlum writes, “All temperature records are affected by at least three sources of error, each of which differs among the individual station records used.” After discussing each source of error, he explains, “The margin of error … is probably at least ±0.1°C for surface air temperature records, … [making] it statistically impossible to classify any year as ‘record-breaking,’ as several other years may be within the margin of error.”

So much for the breathless claims made almost every year by politicians, government-funded researchers, environmental lobbyists, and the corporate media that new global average high temperature records have been set yet again, almost always citing land-based measuring systems compromised by a growing urban heat island bias. When each “new record high” temperature measured is within the margin of error, it’s hard to establish definitely any new record has been set.

“A year ago, I warned that there was great risk in using computer modelling and immature science to make extraordinary claims,” said Humlum in discussing the takeaway message of his report. “The empirical observations I have reviewed show very gentle warming and no evidence of a climate crisis.”

In the end, most of the alarming claims made about a looming human-caused climate apocalypse are based on flawed computer model projections, not physical measurements of changes in the climate. The general circulation models widely used by the climate alarm community grossly overestimate warming. As a result, they have been unable to portray past or present temperatures or temperature trends accurately. Commenting on this and Humlum’s study, GWPF director Benny Peiser, Ph.D., said,

It’s extraordinary that anyone should think there is a climate crisis. Year after year our annual assessment of climate trends documents just how little has been changing in the last 30 years. The habitual climate alarmism is mainly driven by scientists’ computer modelling rather than observational evidence.

ARCTIC WAS WARMER, HAD LESS ICE 6,000 YEARS AGO … GLACIERS CONTAIN LESS ICE THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED … CORAL BLEACHING MISUNDERSTOOD, MISREPRESENTED

ARCTIC WAS WARMER, HAD LESS ICE 6,000 YEARS AGO

Data from hundreds of temperature reconstructions show the Northern Hemisphere was significantly warmer for much of the past 10,000 years (Holocene) than it is today. A recent study published in Climate of the Past examined the sediment records from 66 glaciers and icecaps (GIC) from all over the Arctic, covering the past 12,000 years.

Based on these records, they conclude the Arctic was warmer 6,000 years ago than it is today. This research suggests many glaciers and icecaps present today disappeared entirely during the summers 6,000 years ago, as they were warmer than at present. The study reports,

[T]he full Arctic compilation suggests that the majority (50% or more) of studied GICs were smaller than present or absent by ∼10 ka. We find the highest percentage (>90%) of Arctic GICs smaller than present or absent in the middle Holocene at ∼ 7-6 ka, probably reflecting more spatially ubiquitous and consistent summer warmth during this period than in the early Holocene. … Our review finds that in the first half of the Holocene, most of the Arctic’s small GICs became significantly reduced or melted away completely in response to summer temperatures that, on average, were only moderately warmer than today.

GLACIERS CONTAIN LESS ICE THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED

Research published in Nature Geoscience finds the world’s glaciers contain less ice than previously estimated.

The researchers involved in this study used new satellite imaging techniques to measure the thickness of more than 250,000 mountain glaciers around the world, for the first time, allowing them to calculate more accurately the volume of ice in different glaciers. The survey accounted for more than 98 percent of the world’s glaciers, including some in Europe, New Zealand, and South America that were never mapped before.

This research by scientists from universities and research institutes in Denmark, France, and the United States is important because millions of people around the world depend on freshwater in glaciers, as they melt seasonally, for drinking water, agriculture, and electric power generation. An accurate understanding of how much water glaciers contain is critical both for planning for glacier-dependent populations’ future water supplies and for glaciers’ possible contributions to sea level rise.

Among the findings are that the Himalayan glaciers contain approximately 37 percent more ice than previous surveys estimated. By contrast, Andean glaciers contain 27 percent less ice than formerly believed, if this research is correct.

Glaciologist Romain Millan, lead author of the study, told Bloomberg he “hopes scientists will use this new tool to model the future availability of glacial water. ‘It’s important for policymakers to anticipate the effects of climate change on glaciers and water supplies.'”

The research also indicates glacial melting is contributing 20 percent less to sea level rise than previously estimated, and that if all mountain glaciers melted—excluding those in in Greenland and Antarctica—ocean levels would increase by about 10 inches instead of the 13 inches previously projected.

Climate alarmists cannot claim the study results provide proof climate change is causing glaciers to melt faster than previously estimated. The authors make it clear the lower ice volume numbers derive solely from a correction in the way ice volumes are calculated, not that ice has melted faster and thereby decreased volumes.

CORAL BLEACHING MISUNDERSTOOD, MISREPRESENTED

In the April 16 edition of The Quadrant, marine biologist Walter Starck, Ph.D., writes much of the concern about coral bleaching is misplaced because of a misunderstanding on the part of journalists and the public about how coral reefs function and how they vary from location to location and at different depths.

Starck provides a bevy of facts about how various species interact with and move in and out of corals seasonally and in response to short-term perturbations from spikes or dips in ocean temperatures. Starck explains the following (quoted in part):

Different strains of the algae are optimised to the differing seasonal temperatures and geographic regions. The strains of algae living in the tissues of corals change in accord with seasonal changes in water temperature. Such changes are usually gradual and the change in algae is not visually apparent.

However, a more rapid change in temperature can result in the existing algal strain being expelled from the corals and appearing bleached. Such rapid changes in temperature are not rare. Atmospheric cold fronts can result in sudden cooling. Likewise, calm periods lasting a week or more in warmer months can result in several degrees of warming near the surface when wave-driven mixing and water flows across shallow reefs fade away.

If a temperature change is only brief, as in the wind returning after a calm period, the expelled algal strain may just be re-established. If the change is seasonal, a new strain of algae may replace the previous one. Such recovery can be relatively quick. A few weeks after a bleaching event, corals usually appear normal again.

Bleaching mostly affects shallow reef areas where it is also conspicuous. … The vulnerable shallow areas are also subject to occasional devastation from storms, floods or even just a good rain if it occurs when corals are exposed by a low tide.

Starck provides evidence the extent of bleaching in recent events on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) was greatly overstated because of survey locations and methodologies, and that most of the bleached coral recovered. In 2021, just four years after the last major bleaching event, Australia’s survey of the GBR found the highest level of coral cover ever recorded in the three and a half decades of the survey record.

“[I]ncidents of coral bleaching are nothing new, unusual or threatening,” writes Starck. “They are common natural event[s] no more threatening than trees shedding their leaves with the changing seasons, or occasionally in response to a dry spell.”

It’s Time for Transparency of the Embedded Costs of Going “Green”,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The worldwide movement toward the electrification of everything, from intermittent electricity by industrial wind and solar farms, to more electric vehicles, the political actions are supportive of jumping onto the green train, most-likely not knowing there is a darker side of green technology, associated with environmental degradation, humanity atrocities, and other embedded costs for materials.

A recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) notes: “A typical electric car requires six times the mineral inputs of a conventional car and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more mineral resources than a gas-fired plant”.

Nickel: A major component of the EV batteries, is found just below the topsoil in the Rainforests of Indonesia and the Philippines. As a result, the nickel is extracted using horizontal surface mining that results in extensive environmental degradation: deforestation and removal of the top layer of soil.

Lithium: Over half of the world’s Lithium reserves are found in three South American countries that border the Andes Mountains: Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. These countries are collectively known as the “Lithium Triangle”.

Cobalt: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) produces 70% of the world’s Cobalt. While there is no shortage of environmental issues with its Cobalt mining, the overriding problem here is human rights: dangerous working conditions and the use of child labor. Cobalt is a toxic metal. Prolonged exposure and inhalation of Cobalt dust can lead to health issues of the eyes, skin, and lungs.

Copper: Chile is the leading producer of the world’s Copper. Most of the Chile’s Copper comes from open pit/strip mines. This type of mining negatively affects vegetation, topsoil, wildlife habitats, and groundwater. The next three largest producers of copper are Peru, China, and the infamous Democratic Republic of the Congo.

For the last few decades, policy has been dominated by ideological pipe dreamers that the world can survive and prosper with intermittent and unreliable electricity generated from breezes and sunshine, and to-date they have succeeded in wrecking livelihoods inflicting shortages, inflation, and undermining national security. It’s time to look again at fracking, at nuclear, and focus on conservations, improving efficiencies, and adaptation. It’s time to get serious about climate and electricity.

The non-existing transparency of human rights abuses and environmental degradation occurring in developing countries with yellow, brown, and black skinned people are obscured from most of the world’s population. Both human rights abuses and environmental degradation are directly connected to the mining for the exotic minerals and metals that are required to manufacture wind turbines, solar panels, and EV batteries.

An electric vehicle battery does not “make” electricity – it only stores electricity produced elsewhere, primarily by coal, uranium, natural gas-powered plants, and occasionally by intermittent breezes and sunshine. So, to say an EV is a zero-emission vehicle is not at all valid as 80 percent of the electricity generated to charge the batteries is from coal, natural gas, and nuclear.

For a pleasant and educational Fireside Chat on Energy Literacy between Ronald Stein and avid Environmentalist Nancy Pearlman, check out Nancy’s Environmental Directions 30-minute YouTube interview “ED 2298 Ronald Stein Clean Energy Exploitations” for discussions are about the messages in the Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy“.

To make the embedded costs of going “green” transparent to the world, the book highlights how Asians and Africans, many of them children from the poorer and less healthy countries, are being enslaved and are dying in mines and factories to obtain the exotic minerals and metals required for the green energy technologies for the construction of EV batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and utility-scale storage batteries.

America could promote sustainable mining in those developing countries to restoring the land to a healthy ecosystem after the mine closes and by leaving surrounding communities with more wealth, education, health care, and infrastructure that they had before the mine went into production. Like the mining in America, the mining in developing countries must be the objective of corporate social responsibilities and the outcome of the successful ecological restoration of landscapes.

America’s obsession for green electricity to reduce emissions must be ethical and should not thrive off human rights and environmental abuses in the foreign countries providing the exotic minerals and metals to support America’s green passion. And before we get rid of crude oil, the greenies need to identify the replacement or clone for crude oil, to keep today’s societies and economies running with the more than 6,000 products now made with manufactured derivatives from crude oil, along with the fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of more than 50,000 jets and more than 50,000 merchant ships, and the military and space programs.

Don’t Look Up!,Paul Driessen,"In the Netflix movie, Washington politicians “Don’t Look Up” because they prefer to remain oblivious to a special effects meteor that’s about to obliterate Planet Earth. Not surprisingly, the film is really about our refusal to recognize the “existential threat” of “manmade climate change.”

Director Adam McKay recently tweeted, “We’ve got 6-8 years before the climate is so chaotic we [will] live in a permanent state of biblical catastrophe.”

Not to be outdone, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the latest UN climate report “a file of shame, cataloguing the empty pledges that put us firmly on track toward an unlivable world.” Drilling for more oil and gas is “moral and economic madness,” he insisted. If humanity doesn’t stop using fossil fuels, we will be overwhelmed by devastating floods, heat waves, droughts, fires and crop failures.

Global sea levels have already risen “a shocking nine inches,” the PurpleOrange PR Agency proclaimed, promoting a client’s Climate Neutral Certified label, which is designed to channel more money to “authentic, immediate climate action.”

Back on the non-parallel-universe Planet Earth, a truly unlivable world would be one without fossil fuels. Not just to generate electricity, cook food, heat homes and water, and power cars, boats, trains and planes – but for fertilizers and insecticides to grow more food on less land, and for plastics, pharmaceuticals, paints, cosmetics, clothing and other essential products. For us today; for billions more tomorrow.

Fossil fuels to extract and process trillions of tons of raw materials, too, and manufacture the millions of wind turbines, billions of solar panels, billions of battery modules and millions of transmission line towers that would blanket our croplands, scenic areas and wildlife habitats if we didn’t have fossil fuels.

In fact, far worse than a warmer planet with more airborne plant-fertilizing carbon dioxide would be a colder planet with less CO2. That would mean less arable land, shorter growing seasons and much lower crop yields, on top of losses from a devastated Ukraine and sanctioned Russian wheat crops.

(Why is it that Twitter twits never cancel, suppress or even fact-check climate fear porn? Why is it never just climate change, but always climate cataclysms? Why always manmade climate change, as though past natural climate changes never happened? Why do Guterres, Gore, Kerry, Biden and AOC always have to top his, her, hir, ver, zir fellow alarmists in hysteria? Why is the fear-mongering always based on computer models, never on actual data and evidence? Why does it always ignore China’s massive fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions?)

One of the prevalent climate alarm themes is sea level rise.

Back on real Earth, if the DC Swamp inhabitants of 35 million years ago had looked up, they’d have been transfixed in their last moments by a non-special-effects meteor hurtling into what is now Cape Charles, Virginia on the Chesapeake Bay. The 2-mile-wide meteor obliterated and pulverized sediments and bedrock, vaporized plants and animals, sent rock fragments hundreds of miles in every direction, and launched tsunamis into West Virginia’s eastern mountain slopes.

Shattered rock settled back into a crater 4,300 feet deep and 53 miles in diameter. Over the ensuing millennia, river and ocean sediments poured into the crater – and mile-high glaciers pulled 10-million cubic miles of water out of the oceans, burying half of North America, Europe and Asia under trillions of tons of ice. Land under the ice was pressed down, while land outside the glacial zones was lifted up. Then, some 12,000 years ago, the last Pleistocene glaciers began melting.

Oceans slowly rose – some 400 feet! Land masses underwent “isostatic rebound.” Areas that had been under the ice began rising; those that had bulged upward began sinking. In much of the Chesapeake Bay region, post-glacial subsidence is compounded by continued compression of pulverized crater rock – and by the ongoing withdrawal of groundwater from sedimentary aquifers beneath urban and agricultural areas that depend on groundwater.

The aquifers include layers of porous sandstone (with water between sand grains) interspersed among layers of impermeable but water-soaked shale and clay. As water is pumped out of the sandy layers, the shale-clay layers get squeezed by hundreds of feet of overlying rock and sediment, and their water is forced into the sandstones, and then into pumps. The overlying land steadily subsides.

In the Chesapeake Bay area, subsidence averages nearly 3 mm/year; 11.5 inches per century. That’s in addition to almost 4.5 inches per century in isostatic subsidence, plus 7 to 9 inches per century in actual sea level rise. The total perceived sea level rise can be 24 inches per century – although two-thirds of that total has nothing to do with actual sea level rise. Indeed, the Norfolk Naval Station tide gauge at Sewell’s Point shows that the rate of actual sea level rise has not changed since the gauge was installed in 1927.

The situation in Houston-Galveston, Texas, Santa Clara Valley, California, and other places around the globe is similarly complicated, even without post-glaciation issues. To single out actual sea level rise – and blame the rise on humans and fossil fuels – is simply disingenuous.

However, salt-water intrusion and coastal flooding are serious, recurrent, growing problems, especially during hurricanes and as more expensive homes are built along coasts. Some communities have slowed subsidence by relocating groundwater pumping stations away from the coast, reducing withdrawal rates, increasing aquifer recharge, or substituting surface water for groundwater. Others have installed sea walls, improved drainage systems, and pipelines to bring water from nearby lakes and rivers. Other options include desalination plants to create more fresh water, recycling household “gray water” to agricultural use, and switching to less water-intensive irrigation methods, as Israel does.

These approaches are far more practical and cost-effective than trying to stop seas from rising any further, like a modern King Canute, by banning fossil fuels, especially if it’s done only in some Western nations.

Meanwhile, inhabitants of Tuvalu, the Maldives and other Pacific islands and coral atolls worry about rising seas due to fossil fuels. However, most of them are increasing in land area, not decreasing – as corals grow, sediments are laid down off their coasts, and volcanic lava flows expand land masses.

Moreover, few of these islands and coral reefs even existed 12,000 years ago, when the Wisconsin Glaciation extracted 400 feet of seawater from the world’s oceans. The islands and atolls began growing as the seas rose. They’ve continued growing with every additional foot of sea level rise since the last Ice Age and the Little Ice Age (1350-1850) – and show no signs of stopping.

Cosquer Cave’s Paleolithic paintings near Marseille, France (the entrance is 115 feet below current sea level) and a Mel Fisher dive team’s discovery of charred tree branches and pine cones from a forest fire 8,400 years ago in 40 feet of water off the Florida coast further attest to steadily rising seas.

Yet, experts tell us. (1) “Snows are less frequent and less deep. The rivers scarcely ever freeze over now. There is an unfortunate fluctuation between heat and cold in the spring, which is very fatal to fruits.” (2) “We were astonished by the total absence of ice in Barrow Strait. I was here at this time [six years ago] – still frozen up – and doubts were entertained as to the possibility of escape.” (3) “The Arctic Ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer, and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot.”

It behooves to take action. Or perhaps not. Quotation (1) is from Thomas Jefferson’s diary, 1799; (2) from Sir Francis McClintock’s ship’s log, 1860; (3) from a Washington Post article, November 2, 1922.

Instead of parroting scare stories – and demanding that fossil fuels be replaced by pseudo-clean, pseudo-renewable energy – it really behooves us to think, analyze, ponder the many ways fossil fuels improve our lives, and demand real evidence instead of GIGO computer models for any supposed climate crisis.

Are The Environmental Impacts and Human Atrocities Worth an EV Battery?,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The worldwide movement toward the electrification of everything, from more electric vehicles (EV’s) to more intermittent electricity by wind turbines and solar panels, the political actions are supportive of jumping onto the green train, most-likely not knowing there is a darker side of green technology, associated with environmental degradation, humanity atrocities, and other embedded costs for materials.

It should concern everyone that those toxic components come from mining for the exotic minerals and metals that are required to manufacture EV batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels. This mining is occurring mostly in less-developed countries with yellow, brown, and black skinned people with a lack of transparency to the human rights abuses and environmental degradation in those locations.

In an attempt to make the embedded costs of going “green” transparent to the world, the Pulitzer Prize nominated book, Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy highlights how Asians and Africans, many of them children from the poorer and less healthy countries, are being enslaved and are dying in mines and factories to obtain the exotic minerals and metals required for the green energy technologies for the construction of EV batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and utility-scale storage batteries.

The Tesla EV has a one-thousand-pound battery that contain 25 pounds of lithium, 60 pounds of nickel, 44 pounds of manganese, 30 pounds cobalt, 200 pounds of copper, and 400 pounds of aluminum, steel, and plastic. Inside the Tesla battery are 6,831 individual lithium-ion cells

The environmental impact of battery production is significant. The production of lithium is either carbon dioxide polluting or wasteful of water — up to 500,000 gallons per ton of the mineral. Cobalt mining produces radioactive contaminants, including uranium. About 80 percent of the weight of a Tesla battery –requires mined materials. In practice, that means mining about 50 tons of raw ore per vehicle. If 10 million U.S.-based electric cars are sold in 2030 (about half of sales), that would translate to 500 million tons of new mining with all the accompanying emissions from mining equipment and the accompanying pollution.

All those toxic components come from mining. For instance, to manufacture each auto battery, you must process 25,000 pounds of brine for the lithium, 30,000 pounds of ore for the cobalt, 5,000 pounds of ore for the nickel, and 25,000 pounds of ore for copper. All told, you dig up 500,000 pounds of the earth’s crust for just – one – Tesla EV battery.

There was already a huge challenge in just making enough EV batteries. As physicist Mark Mills pointed out in the Wall Street Journal: “The International Energy Agency (IEA) finds that with a global energy transition like the one President Biden envisions, demand for key minerals such as lithium, graphite, nickel and rare-earth metals would explode, rising by 4,200 percent, 2,500 percent, 1,900 percent and 700 percent, respectively, by 2040“.

Amnesty International has documented children and adults mining cobalt in narrow man-made tunnels), and the exposure to the dangerous gases emitted during the procurement of these rare minerals, not to mention the destruction of the local ecosystems when the wastewater and other unusable ores are let loose onto the environments they have no choice but to live in because their wages are so infinitesimally small, it should cause us to take a step back and examine our moral obligations to humanity.

Not only might the planet not have the capacity to meet this demand, but many of these materials come from places that are hostile or that we do not control – such as China/Mongolia, the Congo, and Bolivia – leading to an unpredictable supply.

Most electric vehicles in use today are yet to reach the end of their cycle. The first all-electric car to be powered by lithium-ion batteries, the Tesla Roadster, made its market debut in 2008. This means the first generation of electric vehicle batteries have yet to reach the recycling stage. An estimated 11 million tons of spent lithium-ion batteries will flood our markets by 2025, without systems in place to handle them.

The actions of society are currently supportive of jumping onto the EV train, knowing that EV’s have a very dark side of environmental atrocities, and the non-existing transparency of human rights abuses occurring in other countries, both of which are directly connected to the mining for the exotic minerals and metals that are required to manufacture wind turbines, solar panels, and EV batteries.

America could promote sustainable mining in those developing countries to restoring the land to a healthy ecosystem after the mine closes and by leaving surrounding communities with more wealth, education, health care, and infrastructure that they had before the mine went into production. Like the mining in America, the mining in developing countries must be the objective of corporate social responsibilities and the outcome of the successful ecological restoration of landscapes.

America’s passion for EV vehicles to reduce emissions must be ethical and should not thrive off human rights and environmental abuses in the foreign countries providing the exotic minerals and metals to support America’s green passion.

Biden’s Crude Oil Policies May Be The Cause of Shortages and Inflation,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","A year before being inaugurated President in 2021, President Biden professed that “We are going to get rid of fossil fuels.” Before the recent inauguration, America achieved for the first time since Harry Truman was president about 70 years ago, to finally become crude oil independent and no longer held hostage to unstable Petro-powers and the vagaries of foreign crude oil supplies.

The unintended consequences of attempting to rid America and the world of crude oil usage are being realized in supply shortages and soaring prices resulting from the elimination of products and fuels manufactured from crude oil that support:

Asphalt for roughly 65 million miles of roads in the world

Tires for the 1.4 billion vehicles in the world

Fertilizers to feed the world on this increasingly resource-stretched and crowded earth.

Medical supplies that are primarily made from oil derivatives

Jets that comprise more than 50,000 for military, commercial, and private sector.

Merchant ships that comprise more than 53,000 that move products throughout the world

Vehicles that are mostly made of plastics

Renewables of wind turbines and solar panels that are made from oil derivatives

On March 31, 2022, President Biden announced that he will tap into America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and will consume one third of it (180 of the 700 million barrels of oil) in an attempt to control rising gas prices. America consumes an average of about 19.78 million barrels of petroleum per day. The SPR was created following the 1973 energy crisis to have a significant deterrent to oil import cutoffs and a key tool in foreign policy. Using it to lower gas prices may be irresponsible and dangerous to national security.

Unbeknownst to President Biden is that California, with the highest cost of fuel in the nation, will get none of the oil as there are no pipelines over the Sierra Mountains to the California Energy Island.

While renewables continue to underperform in the generation of electricity, crude oil continues to be targeted for elimination along with coal and natural gas, even though oil is seldom used for generating electricity. Today, President Biden supports allowing banks and investment giants to collude to reshape economies and energy infrastructure with their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels. ESG is a very dangerous precedent as the American people never voted to give banks this sort of control over our country.

Biden and ESG supporters need to be careful

about eliminating “all” 3 fossil fuels!

Of the 3 fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil, crude oil is the only one primarily used to manufacture products for society that are the basis of the economy.

Crude oil is virtually useless, unless it’s manufactured (refineries) into oil derivatives that are the basis of more than 6,000 products in our daily lives that did not exist before the 1900’s, and the fuels to move the heavy-weight and long-range needs of aircraft, cruise and merchant ships, and the military and space program.

Wind turbines and solar panels may be able to generate intermittent electricity, but they cannot manufacture anything. BTW, all the products needed to make the parts for vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, planes, ships, medical supplies, tires, asphalt, and fertilizer are made with the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil.

It seems obvious that the efforts to cease the use of crude oil may be the greatest threat to civilization. Attempting to attain a decarbonized world like the one that existed in the 1800’s and before, could result in Billions of fatalities for the 8 billion on earth from disease, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths, versus the projections of millions of fatalities from changes in climate.

Of the 3 fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil, where’s Biden’s and ESG’s replacement or clone for crude oil, to keep today’s societies and economies running?

Biden’s continuous flip-flopping on his crude oil strategies for America

has led to restricted supplies of products

to meet the growing demand for that limited supply.

President Biden continues to send mixed and conflicting oil strategies:

President Biden was against oil with his cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline that would have provided our country with daily crude oil per day from Canada. The results from the Keystone Pipeline that was expected to transport 830,000 barrels to America is that Canada has another buyer in China. Now, that oil is being sent by rail to West coast ports before being loaded onto ships to take it to China. A rail car will hold, on average, 650 barrels. It takes 12 trains of 100 cars each (crude by rail) each day to move 830,000 barrels to the West Coast where it can them be shipped halfway around the world to China.

President Biden was against oil when he bought into the messages from a Russian funded environmental group that gave millions to anti-fracking groups to support the GND and to stop, curtail or severely weaken US fracking of crude oil and natural gas in states like Texas, North Dakota, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Pennsylvania by implementing multiple restrictions on domestic oil production.

Following the cyberattack against the Colonial Pipeline in May, 2022 that almost shut down the East Coast, President Biden was for oil by Begging OPEC+ to boost oil production to combat skyrocketing gas prices and spiraling costs for the products from fossil fuels while kneecapping abundant U.S. energy production.

President Biden was for oil when oil imports from Russia made up 8 percent of U.S. oil imports. When he finally blocked oil imports from Russia, President Biden continued his push for imported crude oil when he started looking to Venezuela, but that country owes around $100 billion to its external creditors, including China and Russia. Some reports put the figure higher. With the current situation of indebtedness to China and Russia, and the unstable government in Venezuela, this is not a pretty picture.

The domino effect of tinkering with flip-flopping oil strategies for the supply chain of crude oil may be continued supply shortages and soaring prices for the thousands of products that support the entire medical industry, all branches of the military, airports, electronics, communications, merchant ships, container ships, and cruise liners, as well as asphalt for roads, tires, and fertilizers to help feed the world.

President Biden and the ESGers appear to lack a basic understanding of what crude oil is used for, as they tinker with the supply chain of crude oil that supports the lifestyles and economies that did not exist in the decarbonized 1800’s.

PRESS RELEASE: Heartland Institute Climate Experts React to Latest UN IPCC Report,"H. Sterling Burnett, James Taylor, Linnea Lueken, Tim Benson, Anthony Watts","ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL (April 7, 2022) – The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) this week. IPCC chairman Hoesung Lee claimed “we are at a crossroads” but need to start reducing overall global emissions of carbon dioxide after 2025 to “secure a livable future.” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said unless we dramatically reduce CO2 emissions, humanity faces a future of “unprecedented heatwaves, terrifying storms, widespread water shortages and the extinction of a million species of plants and animals.”

Climate science and policy experts at The Heartland Institute strongly disagree with this assessment. The Heartland Institute is the world’s most-prominent think tank promoting the work of scientists and other experts who do not think human activity is causing a climate crisis.

“The IPCC report is tantamount to ‘old whine (pun intended), in new bottles.’ There is nothing truly new in this report. It makes the same unsubstantiated claims of doom, and the same unsubstantiated claims that we can act now, to, in a very short time period, end the use of fossil fuels to save the earth, and profit in the process. The projections of climate models have repeatedly proven inaccurate, and the resources simply do not exist to – in the time frame the IPCC says saving the planet demands – remake the entire global economy sans fossil fuels. In the process of trying, we would destroy the environment by mining, erecting wind turbines and solar arrays, to save it.”

“For seemingly the 32nd year in a row, the agenda-driven climate bureaucrats producing IPCC reports tell us that we have just one more year to save humanity from a climate crisis.

“While doomsday predictions grab headlines, real-world data continues to frustrate and counter the extreme claims made by the IPCC. The computer model projections these reports lean on continue to fail to represent past or present temperature changes, and so remain more science fiction than fact. Since this year’s report boasts a greater proportion of social scientists and a focus on ‘social justice’ than in years past, I think it is safe to say that the IPCC is slowly abandoning even the façade of data-driven credibility.”

“The IPCC is relying on questionable information to make an even more-questionable forecast into the future. For example. it has been proven that the RCP 8.5 climate model forecast is impossibly hot because there is simply not enough fossil fuel on the planet to put that much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. A peer-reviewed study proved this. Yet the bureaucrats continue to use that climate model because it supports their belief system.

“Their forecast is also predicated on an over-simplistic idea that carbon dioxide is the single controlling factor for the climate. In fact, the climate is exceptionally complex with hundreds of factors in it – many of which aren’t even properly dealt with in the climate models, such as clouds. If you look back at forecast made by the UN over the last 30-plus years, you’ll see that many of them have not even come close to being true. The confidence level in this particular report therefore should be very low.”

Newsom’s energy regulations have oil tankers emitting more than twice what all of California’s vehicle fleet do,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","California’s crude oil demands have been increasing year over year, since 1995, except for pandemic years. Maritime transportation is one of the greatest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, Governor Newsom continually decreases in-state oil production, so California and the nation can be further dependent on imports via maritime transportation from foreign countries for the State’s crude oil energy demands.

In international waters, the maritime fleet fuel consumption and emissions remains one of the least regulated parts of our global transportation system. The fuel used in ships is waste oil, what is left over after the crude oil refining process. It is the same as asphalt and is so thick that when cold it can be walked upon.

There are over 50,000 merchant ships trading internationally, transporting every kind of cargo. The world fleet is registered in over 150 nations and manned by over a million seafarers of virtually every nationality.

The low-grade bunker fuel used by the worlds merchant ships is the cheapest and most polluting fuel available. The maritime fuel is consumed not by the gallons, but by tons per hour and contains up to 2,000 times the amount of sulfur compared to diesel fuel used in automobiles.

As a result of continuously decreasing in-state oil production, California has increased imported crude oil from foreign countries from 5 percent in 1992 to 58 percent today of total consumption.

In 2018, California imported a whopping 364,367,000 barrels of crude oil from foreign countries. Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC’s) can transport 2 million barrels of crude oil.

It would require about 175 such VLCC oil tankers traversing the oceans to import 350 million barrels to California.

Those large VLCC’s burn 100 metric tons of fuel/hour, or 261 gallons per hour, which emits about 22 pounds of CO2 per gallon.

A 60-day round trip VLCC voyage to and from Saudi Arabia is 1,440 hours, thus one round trip voyage emits 8,268,480 (261*22*1440) pounds of CO2.

For the 175 VLCC’s needed to import 350 million barrels of crude oil, the total annual oil tankers emissions would be 1,446,984,000 pounds, or more than 720 million metric tons of CO2 to meet California’s needs for foreign crude oil.

California’s statewide 2017 GHG emissions were more than 350 million metric tons .

Due to Newsom’s ever-increasing pressure to reduce in-state oil productions, crude oil import demands from foreign suppliers are on the rise. We can easily see that more than 175 – 2 million barrels of crude oil via VLCC oil tankers that are required to bring in a whopping 364,367,000 barrels of crude oil from foreign countries. Those VLCC’s, emit more than double the emissions as the entire Californian transportation sector, of annual GHG emissions.

Using smaller capacity oil tankers would require more tankers and generate even greater emissions.

Governor Newsom continues to “leak” emissions and air quality responsibilities to developing countries halfway around the world, the same countries that have virtually non-existent environmental regulations nor labor controls to protect the local workers in those developing countries.

Regarding California’s Energy Crisis, blame Sacramento, Not Moscow. California’s politicians and policy makers eagerly emulated Europe’s energy policies for years. Like Europe, California overinvested in breezes and sunshine for electricity, underinvested in crude oil, prematurely shuttered its baseload power plants, and relied overwhelmingly on imported crude oil from foreign countries, and electricity imports from neighboring states. Now, as Europe is ensnared in Vladimir Putin’s energy trap, Californians watch as the state’s energy prices head toward the stratosphere.

A Price Waterhouse Cooper (PwC) report, commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute (API), reinforces how the natural gas and oil industry—in California in particular—is critical to economic revitalization and opportunities for job creation. According to the findings, in 2019, the industry directly and indirectly:

Supported 1,059,000 total jobs (164,600 direct and 894,400 indirect) or 4.3 percent of California’s total employment.

Generated an additional 5.4 jobs elsewhere in California’s economy for each direct job in the state’s natural gas and oil industry.

Provided $94.4 billion in labor income ($24.2 billion direct and $70.2 billion indirect) to California, 5.1 percent of the state’s total.

Contributed $199.3 billion to California’s gross domestic product ($85.3 billion direct and $114 billion indirect), 6.4 percent of the state’s total.

Rather than producing oil in the most environmentally controlled location in the world, in California, the Governor remains oblivious to the negative impact to the world’s emissions from oil tankers, and the negative impacts to the health of the 8 billion on this planet that result from importing oil via polluting oil tankers. In addition, Newsom withholds the many of the economic benefits identified by PwC that would be available to Californians.

There is some good news developing out of that Maritime GHG emissions dark tunnel, as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has implemented new regulations to reduce CO2 emissions 50 percent by 2050 from 2008 levels. But the International Chamber of Shipping stated that by 2050 two-thirds of ALL ships will still be burning the same fuel they do today!!

To help the IMO achieve their emission reduction goals, I found a company, Steele Environmental, that is doing something about the problem today! Founded by Larry Parsons, this company’s ADF fuel catalyst is a drop in, market ready, scalable solution for the global shipping industry that lowers not only CO2 emissions but NO2 and black carbon at the same time! It pays for itself in fuel savings!

The Steele Environmental ADF fuel catalyst, when implemented, will help make the maritime fuels green and alleviate the GHG emissions that Newsom is inflicting upon the world’s atmosphere. Pollution does NOT stop at our borders! Stop polluting the oceans thinking California air is clean. We need to support companies like Steele Environmental that are doing something to address the GHG emissions of the maritime fleet instead of government trying to force restrictions on fossil fuel use.

California’s Governor Newsom insists on continuous efforts to “leak” emissions and air quality responsibilities to developing countries halfway around the world for California’s crude oil demands. This “leakage” has increased the use of maritime transportation that has resulted in California being a huge contributor to worldwide GHG emissions! I hope California’s Governor Newsom can sleep peacefully!

Saving America from planet-threatening fossil fuels,Paul Driessen,"Presidential candidate Joe Biden repeatedly promised to end fossil fuels in America. There’ll be “no more drilling, including offshore,” he said. “No ability for the oil industry to drill. No more pipelines.”



Shortly after reaching the White House, President Biden ended Keystone XL pipeline construction and began working with congressional Democrats, regulators and eco-activists to impose leasing and drilling moratoriums, slow-walk permits, pressure financial institutions to deny funding to fossil fuel companies, and implement “social cost of carbon” rules, “environmental justice” programs, “windfall profit” taxes and other policies to close down or bankrupt fossil fuel projects and companies.



His Securities and Exchange Commission says companies must “disclose risks” from alleged “manmade climate change” – from their own production, refining and manufacturing operations; from suppliers and customers using their products; and from government anti-carbon policies.



Supplies predictably dwindled, and prices skyrocketed. Not just for gasoline and other fossil fuels that still provide 80% of all U.S. energy, but for fertilizers, farm chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paints, plastics, cosmetics and countless other petroleum-based products – and for goods and services that require offices, factories, stores and transport that need reliable, affordable energy. In other words, for nearly everything.



Keystone alone would have brought the United States 700,000 barrels of friendly Canadian oil. That’s equal to the petroleum Russia was sending America before Mr. Biden finally banned the imports, after Vladimir Putin’s butchery in Ukraine reached levels that even far-Left Democrats couldn’t stomach.



President Biden tried to blame Putin for food, fuel and other prices that had been soaring well before the Ukraine invasion. He’s now pleading with American oil companies to increase production – but only temporarily (to send liquefied gas to Europe and to protect Democrat office holders in November), without easing his anti-oil edicts.



He begged Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela to increase their oil production. He used Russia to broker a new nuclear deal with Supreme Leader Ali Khameni, so that Iran can sell more oil on the global market. He apparently believes those sources don’t emit “dangerous” carbon dioxide.



Above all, Team Biden doubled down on calls for America to switch from gasoline cars to electric vehicles, and from coal and natural gas electricity generation to wind, solar and backup battery power. They claim this massive, costly restructuring of America can replace “dirty, planet-threatening” fossil fuels with “clean, renewable, sustainable” wind, solar and battery energy. It’s a duplicitous con.



Wind turbines and solar panels on this scale would defile millions of acres of crop, scenic and habitat land. They would kill millions of birds, bats and other wildlife. They require massive amounts of raw materials (and thus mining) to create expensive, inefficient, weather-dependent energy devices. They and 1000-pound battery modules are the least clean, renewable, sustainable energy sources imaginable.



“Clean” technologies merely replace CO2 and methane emissions in the USA with massive amounts of real, toxic pollution in other countries, out of sight and mind, where climate activists can ignore them.



A Green New Deal would make America almost totally reliant on China, Russia and other despotic and unstable nations for the metals and minerals needed for GND technologies. And for the equipment itself, because a fossil-fuel-free America wouldn’t have the reliable energy needed to manufacture wind turbines, solar panels, battery modules, transformers and thousands of miles of new transmission lines. America’s entire GND energy and economic future could depend on their tyrannical good graces.



China, Russia and their surrogates could wield green tech as a strategic weapon, banning exports of materials or technologies to advance their political goals. They could even embed trip-switches or backdoors for hackers in equipment they sell to us, enabling them to close down part or all of our electrical grid and economy. A shutdown could kill millions.



The quantities of metals, minerals and other raw materials required for this “green energy transition” are almost incomprehensible. We would have to mine Planet Earth on unprecedented scales.



The first stage of President Biden’s offshore wind energy program alone would require 110,000 tons of non-renewable copper – plus millions of tons of cobalt, lithium, nickel, aluminum, iron, manganese, rare earth elements, platinum, plastics, concrete, and that suddenly very visible and valuable metal: nickel.



His plan calls for 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030. That’s 2,140 monstrous 850-foot-tall 14-MW turbines. It sounds like a lot of electricity, but it wouldn’t even meet New York State’s peak summertime electricity needs. And they’d generate zero electricity half the year.



Based on average global copper ore bodies, just those 110,000 tons of copper would require removing 40,000,000 tons of overburden and processing 25,000,000 tons of ore. That’s enough crushed rock to cover a 24-foot-wide highway from Washington, DC to Tampa, Florida ten feet deep! Just for the copper.



(Or you could bury the White House, Capitol Hill, all the most climate-focused federal agencies, and all Greenpeace, Sierra Club and other eco-pressure groups’ DC offices under 100 feet of rock and dust.)



Climate- obsessed legislators, regulators, activists and judges detest and contest mining anywhere in the United States, even to support the Green New Deal they claim is essential to save America, our planet and humanity from “climate cataclysms.” They’ve already made millions of acres off limits to exploration and mining, affecting numerous world-class prospects.



In just the past couple years, they prevented three critically needed mines from opening: Alaska’s Pebble Mine (billions of pounds of copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, rhenium and other metals); Minnesota’s NorthMet mine (billions of pounds of copper, cobalt, platinum and nickel); and enormous lithium deposits in Nevada.



That means GND mining and processing would take place in Asia, Africa and Latin America, mostly by or under the auspices of Chinese firms – under environmental, pollution control, workplace safety, and child and slave labor rules, standards and practices that were repudiated in America 50-100 years ago.



Will the White House, congressional Democrats, EPA, Labor Department and SEC demand that companies disclose all those fossil fuel uses, risks, environmental impacts and human rights abuses?



They loudly promote electric vehicles and a total transformation of the U.S. energy system and economy. But they say nothing about acquiring the raw materials and equipment essential for turning these dreams into reality. They are silent about the land destruction, air and water pollution, wildlife losses, human diseases and deaths, and eco-imperialism that their policies impose, especially on people of color.



They are mute about the ways their “climate protection” racket would allow China, Russia and other thuggish regimes to pursue their territorial ambitions – and give them unprecedented control over the Western World’s energy, jobs, economies, living standards, foreign policies and national security.



They make no attempt to calculate how many wind turbines, solar panels, vehicle and backup battery modules, transformers and transmission lines would be needed in a fossil-fuel-free, all-electricity nation. How many acres of wildlife habitat would be disrupted or destroyed. How many new mines would have to be opened. How many birds, bats and other animals would be killed. How many trillions of tons of ores and overburden would have to be blasted away and processed. Or how many huge landfills we’ll need for all the worn-out turbines, blades, panels and batteries. They certainly don’t discuss how much our living standards, personal choices and basic freedoms would be reduced in their “clean energy” America.



They don’t ask because they don’t want to know – and don’t want us to even think about these issues.



Putin’s Ukraine war has opened eyes about NATO, disarmament and Europe’s feckless reliance on Russian natural gas. We need equal realism about America’s climate and energy policies – and how far America’s ruling elites would take us down the path to ruin, to achieve their Green Utopia.

"SEC Abandons Mission, Goes Woke on Climate Change",H. Sterling Burnett,"With Democrat appointees at the helm and the Biden administration’s encouragement, the supposedly independent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has gone full-on woke on climate change.

Stepping well outside its legal mission to protect investors from fraud and the markets from insider trading and manipulation, the SEC has decided it knows what the managers of publicly traded companies, portfolio and fund managers, and investors should care about. Forget about making profits for companies and their shareholder-owners, a company’s financial condition and prospects based on business and market measures, or providing a secure, comfortable retirement for pensioners. According to the SEC, all of that should take a back seat to fighting climate change.

The SEC has no particular expertise in climate science, and as far as I’ve been able to ascertain, there is no evidence it is staffed by people known to be able to predict the future in general, or even future weather in particular. Nonetheless, the SEC is taking it upon itself to dictate to investors and businesses that they must account for climate change, based on the commission’s opinion that it affects every corporation’s business prospects and that investors should know about it.

The SEC’s proposed rules would require publicly traded companies to track and report on the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from their own operations and those of companies in their supply chain and the electric utilities that supply them power. In addition, companies will have to report on how climate change is affecting their businesses now, how it is likely to affect them in the future, and what they are doing in response, including steps they are taking to reduce non-toxic greenhouse gas emissions.

These rules will take hundreds of millions, possibly billions, of dollars away from businesses’ core operations, to carry out the SEC’s mandate to predict future climate to account for its fiscal effect on business operations and act as their brothers’ keepers by tracking their power companies’ and suppliers’ emissions as well as their own. Where are all the oracles, seers, and carbon accountants companies will have to hire to tell the future and audit their own and other companies’ expected emissions?

Much of the clothing sold by large, publicly traded retail chains and the electronics sold by publicly traded department, electronics, and cell phone stores and outlets is manufactured by overseas companies and shipped using foreign-registered ships. The sources for these items are not under the purview or control of the SEC and are unlikely to waste money tracking carbon dioxide emissions from their production activities, much less from the source of their electricity and supply vendors just because the SEC wants their corporate American customers to waste resources tracking such emissions.

What about incorporated fast food giants and grocery stores? Regardless of whether their beef, chicken, pork, and seafood, the wheat that goes into their buns, and the vegetables and fruits they use or sell come from domestic producers or foreign sources, the producers are often going to be relatively small, unincorporated operations, not bound by the SEC’s mandate. That will complicate the corporations’ supply chain reporting.

The reports could therefore be woefully incomplete, opening the companies up to SEC investigations for lack of compliance and transparency, and to activists’ protests or lawsuits for inadequate or incomplete reporting. Alternately, the corporate behemoths might attempt to force their foreign manufacturers and domestic or foreign farmers and ranchers to monitor or report their carbon emissions if they want to continue doing business with the corporate giants. The latter is what I expect the SEC wants the big companies to do: throw their financial weight around to make small producers comply with the Biden administration’s climate goals.

It may not be so easy. The producers could tell their corporate SEC climate overlords to take a flying leap, selling their goods elsewhere, such as burgeoning markets in China, India, and Brazil. They could sell to countries where regulators, to the extent they exist at all, are more focused on helping companies make a profit and create jobs for their people than obsessing over distant, unknowable, and probably unwarranted climate fears. That would raise prices of all these goods in the United States by reducing supplies, further fueling inflation, which is already out of hand. In addition, we can expect the current U.S. supply chain crisis and increasingly empty shelves to look great by comparison with what’s to come.

Alternatively, the overseas and small domestic producers could attempt to track their emissions. Doing so, however, would add to their costs, and those added costs would certainly be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, just as the higher energy costs we are currently experiencing primarily because of Biden’s climate policies are responsible for a large portion of today’s high inflation rate and rising consumer prices.

Under either scenario, these policies will harm consumers. They will also harm investors, pension funds, and retirees—the very groups the SEC is supposed to be protecting.

The factors likely to effect materially the success or failure of publicly traded companies are best known to the officers and managers of the firms and funds themselves, not the SEC, other regulatory agencies, politicians, or self-appointed stakeholders, including climate activists, not actively involved in the relevant business.

The effects of climate change 20, 30, 50, or 100 years from now are unknown and unknowable. The projections of climate-simulating computer models of future conditions cannot be trusted. They have consistently overstated past and present temperatures, the most basic projections they have to make. The models have also consistently misidentified various climate conditions and weather events. Any projections made by climate modelers should be taken with a huge amount of salt.

Although private companies and businesses may be formed for any number of nonbusiness-related reasons unique to their owners’ personal desires and proclivities, publicly traded companies are formed to make a profit for their owners, although the managers may also list other reasons for a company’s formation in their statements of incorporation and disclosures. Accordingly, the managers of publicly traded companies and funds should endeavor to maximize profits for their investors.

Pension fund managers typically have legal fiduciary responsibilities to do just that, not to undertake investment decisions based on nonbusiness considerations with a high likelihood of reducing portfolio returns. The politics of a company’s or a fund’s managers should not enter into its business or investment decisions, unless the mangers explicitly state in their articles of incorporation and public disclosures that business and investment decisions will be driven by a particular ideological point of view or set of political concerns. Many or most investors will wisely avoid such funds.

If regulators, politicians, and activists want a company or fund to consider climate change risks, effects, and opportunities in its business and investment decisions, they can purchase stock or bonds issued by the company, as every other investor does. Then, at annual board meetings or other periodic company events they can express their desires as co-owners. They can try to convince company or fund managers to consider potential climate change risks and rewards and monitor and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

Failing at that, they can introduce climate-related resolutions, offer like-minded candidates for the board of directors, and try to convince a majority of stock owners to support their resolutions, directives, and slates of candidates. Thousands of climate-related resolutions, and candidates for board positions focused on climate concerns, have been offered over the past few decades. Most have been soundly rejected by investors. This, not probably illegal SEC mandates, is the appropriate way for companies and funds to take climate concerns seriously.

As the SEC itself notes, many businesses are already tracking their carbon dioxide emissions and forecasting the effects of climate change on their operations. Other companies are choosing to ignore emissions or climate change as a business factor. They should be allowed to make that choice. Which course of action is better for any particular company’s profitability and ongoing business operations? I don’t know, and neither does the SEC.

Portfolio fund managers and others concerned about climate or sustainability matters can form their own companies and funds, complete with public stock offerings, to compete with the businesses they believe are not taking climate change concerns seriously enough. Thousands of such green companies and funds have been formed. This lets people express their concern for the environment directly through their purchases and investment decisions.

The SEC’s role in these matters should be limited to ensuring “truth in advertising”—a policing function. The SEC should not attempt to develop or enforce uniform standards defining what it means for a company to take climate seriously. Instead, the SEC should simply require transparency from those companies and funds that profess to be “green,” climate-friendly, or committed to reducing their energy use and greenhouse gas emissions as a business strategy and a way to attract investors. In publicly available documents and disclosures, the companies and funds should be required to state specifically what practices they are undertaking to respond to climate change and how and on what timeline their efforts to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions should be judged.

In addition to ensuring the transparent disclosure of allegedly climate-friendly practices and operations, the SEC should routinely monitor and police businesses claiming to embrace “green” policies, as they do with other promises businesses make to investors. The SEC should also respond to complaints from investors about companies failing to carry out their mission as stated and, working with the Department of Justice, ensure the companies’ officers, employees, and investors are not involved in or undertaking illegal business practices such as insider trading.

The SEC has no expertise in climate change and has not shown any ability to predict the future reliably. There is no nonpolitical justification for the SEC to require businesses to account for their climate risks, much less those of their business associates. The SEC should stick to regulating insider trading and false business claims and leave decisions about how to maximize business prospects in the face of potential but unknowable climate change to the owners and managers of those businesses.

CHINA CONFIRMS CONTINUED COAL EXPANSION … NO NET EMISSIONS FROM DEFORESTATION

CHINA CONFIRMS CONTINUED COAL EXPANSION

At a mid-March meeting of China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress committed to making full use of coal, both domestically produced and imported from abroad, to keep energy prices low and power supplies reliable to promote economic stability.

Chinese President Xi Jinping reassured the assembled representatives, especially those from Inner Mongolia, its biggest coal-producing region, that China “could not part from reality,” that the country is “rich in coal, poor in oil and short of gas.”

Commenting on what this announcement means for Western countries committed to ending the use of coal to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions to fight purported climate change, Clarice Feldman writes in The Pipeline,

The joke’s on you, suckers: as the United States and Europe struggle with energy shortages because they’ve restricted the use and production of conventional fuels, China ups its use of coal, doubtless laughing at the western idiots who bought the disinformational “climate change” hoax.

NO NET EMISSIONS FROM DEFORESTATION

New research published in the journal Nature shows deforestation is not causing a net increase in carbon dioxide.

A team of researchers from universities and research institutes in the Netherlands and the United States examined proxy data to account for the fraction of carbon dioxide emissions related to land use, particularly the effects of deforestation and wildfires.

Their research shows that although emissions from deforestation have increased since 1958, the share of carbon dioxide attributable to deforestation and other land use changes has declined by 0.014 ± 0.010−1 per decade due to improved uptake of emissions by the land and oceans from systemic factors such as forest expansion and general global greening. Nature has more than kept pace with growing emissions from land use changes. It appears the land and oceans’ abilities to remove and store carbon has become more efficient over time. The increasing uptake and storage of emissions was especially acute from the 1960s through the 1980s, slowing in recent decades.

Guido van der Werf, a professor at the VU University of Amsterdam, who set up the study, specializes in the study of the global carbon cycle. Van der Werf says although we can’t know whether the Earth and seas will keep up with increases in emissions from land use changes and deforestation in the future, “What we can mainly prove is that the worst nightmare scenarios of an impaired carbon sink have not yet materialized and that the news is not quite as bad.”

Tsunamis May Sink West Coast Offshore Wind,David Wojick,"In my last article I raised the concern that East Coast offshore wing machines might not withstand destruction by the hurricanes that frequently run up the coast. Offshore wind design has been developed in Europe, where hurricanes do not occur. This makes their proposed use in places like Virginia very much an untested experiment.

See my https://www.cfact.org/2022/03/11/dominions-deception-hits-new-high-with-offshore-wind/.

In the comments someone mentioned tsunamis versus hurricanes. For those not familiar with the term, a tsunami is a big tidal wave caused by an undersea earthquake. I have never heard of tsunamis as a threat to offshore wind installations, so I did a bit of digging. Below is what I found.

Tsunamis are a serious threat to offshore wind machines along the West Coast. This is due to a combination of features. First, there is relatively little continental shelf, so a lot of offshore wind machines will be floating, not standing on the bottom. Second, the threat of tsunamis is very high because the entire West Coast is earthquake country.

These features are part of what is called “plate tectonics”. The “solid earth” we live on is actually just a very thin crust on a huge molten ball. The continents are around 100 miles thick, while the molten Earth is 8,000 miles in diameter.

Moreover this thin solid crust is in big pieces, which are called plates. These plates move around slowly, propelled by currents in the huge molten mass below. This colossal activity is called plate tectonics.

The plates rub on each other and this causes earthquakes when the rubbing is jerky. Even bigger, sometimes one plate is forced below another when they jam together. This monster activity is called subduction and it too causes earthquakes. One plate jamming into another is what causes mountains. For that matter what we call sea level rise may just be the ocean basins changing shape tectonically.

All of this tectonic activity is happening along the entire West Coast. The famous San Andreas fault is where the Pacific plate is sliding northward along the North American plate. Less well known is the undersea Cascadia subduction zone, which runs from Northern California to the northern tip of Vancouver Island in Canada.

Subduction is the reason there is very little continental shelf to mount offshore wind machines on. The shelf along the mountainous western coast of the United States is narrow, measuring only about 20 miles wide on average, whereas that off the eastern coast extends more than 75 miles in width. The western shelf is also rugged like the onshore mountains, while the eastern shelf is pretty flat.

Subduction is also why the threat of powerful tsunamis along the Pacific coast is rated “high to very high” by the experts. These ratings are made in a useful document called the “NTHMP Tsunami Information Guide” from the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, which was formed by law in 1995. Led by NOAA, the NTHMP also includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and 28 U.S. states and territories.

See https://nws.weather.gov/nthmp/guide/nthmptsunamiinfoguide.pdf

By way of scale the Tsunami Guide says the Cascadia subduction zone may well produce a 60 foot high tsunami in the not too distant future. I cannot imagine an 800 foot tall floating wind machine being hit by such a monster wave without falling over and/or sinking.

My point here is the same as with the East Coast hurricanes. These are real threats that need to be properly designed for, if that is even possible. All I am seeing are feel good articles saying how we are going to build thousands of these monster machines lining our coasts. How will these ungainly monsters survive these threats when they happen, which they will?

Show us the engineering.","March 28, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/tsunamis-may-sink-west-coast-offshore-wind/
One Hand at Politico Doesn’t Know What the Other Hand Is Writing,Seton Motley,"I always find it amusing when one Big Media member reports something that totally contradicts something another member of the same Big Media outlet reports. It’s schadenfreude, to be sure. But I hope I can be forgiven this delve into human weakness.

I do not know Joshua Siegel. I can’t find his age online – he looks to be 20-something. Which would mean he was in junior high school when I left DC for good. According to his Check-marked Twitter bio, Siegel writes for the exceedingly awful Pathetico – oops, I mean Politico. But a cursory Web search shows that prior to that, Siegel wrote for two excellent outlets – the Washington Examiner and the Daily Signal.

Siegel is an “energy and climate reporter.” So he’s on the carbon beat. I too am, in a sense, on the same beat. Which is why a month ago I wrote this….

Border Carbon Tax: DC Can Do Better – When It Chooses to Do So:

“Last September, we were the only non-Democrat country championing the carbon border tax.

“Democrats Propose Border Tax Based On Carbon Emissions:

“Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) announced Monday a new import tax for countries failing to meet U.S. carbon emissions standards….

“Goods covered by the proposal include petroleum, coal, aluminum, steel, iron and cement.

“The tax would be on par with the environmental fees levied against American companies under state and federal regulations….

“‘We must ensure that U.S. workers and manufacturers aren’t left behind…” Coons said….”

“What a novel concept for DC that is.

“Flash forward to last week. And the carbon border adjustment tax’s popularity has grown – and grown bipartisan. And both sides are citing former President Donald Trump – just as we did in September.

“The Bipartisan Climate Solution:

“Momentum is building on both sides of the aisle to come up with a measure to penalize imports of high polluting goods, and lawmakers are taking a page out of former President Donald Trump’s book….

“‘It looks and feels a lot like Trump’s tariffs…’ Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said.

“Republicans are eager to tackle competition with China, whose lax environmental standards often mean lower production prices, and create an ‘America-first’ climate policy. ‘Donald Trump should love it,’ (Republican) Sen. Kevin Cramer said.”

“The Bipartisan Climate Solution” – announcing the broad bipartisan support for a border carbon tax – was published at 10am on February 18. By Matthew Choi – in Politico. Siegel’s employer. In its “Morning Energy” newsletter – Siegel’s beat.

But that very same morning, at 9:46 am, Siegel Tweeted:

“Graham is an exception among Republicans on the issue, telling me: ‘A border adjusted carbon tax? Count me in. That’s basically a tariff on polluters.'”

But Graham isn’t “an exception.” Per Siegel’s own publication. Which quotes Republican North Dakota Senator Kevin Cramer effusively praising the notion – as part of a “momentum…building on both sides of the aisle.”

But like ships passing in the morning, Siegel and Choi appear to walk by each other in the Politico Energy hallway – and not share their work.

I found it amusing. Human frailty.

By February 24, Siegel appears to have been made privy to Choi’s work.

Congress Is Eyeing a Bipartisan Climate Trade Policy – Thanks to Trump:

“Trump advanced a combative trade policy that wielded tariffs as a weapon, opening the door for Republicans to consider a protectionist trade policy linked to addressing climate change….

“Republicans and Democrats are working together on plans to penalize imports of high-polluting goods, a rare bipartisan effort in Congress that could insert climate change policy into U.S. trade rules….

“(L)awmakers are taking a new look at so-called border carbon adjustment fees, which would be tacked onto products from foreign companies whose carbon emissions are higher than those of their U.S. competitors.

“Those products are often cheaper to make abroad because of weak pollution regulations — giving them an economic advantage over more climate-friendly U.S.-based manufacturers of products such as steel.”

The Politico self-contradictory nonsense aside: What matters most is that we stop allowing foreign manufacturers to undercut our domestic manufacturers.

Because we allowed it for the last half-century-plus. And it gutted and hollowed-out our nation.

An Oversupply Of EV’s From Foreign Manufacturers And A Lack Of Demand May Be A Financial Shock To The World,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","Amid tougher emissions regulations worldwide, established automakers are racing to add more EVs to their lineup. A Reuters analysis found that global automakers such as Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Fiat, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Nissan, Toyota, Daimler, and Chrysler plan to spend a combined U.S. $300 billion on EVs over the next decade as car companies are betting big on EV’s. Most of the EV’s will be manufactured in foreign countries far removed from American ports.

China came from zero production in 1950, to 2019 where it now produces more cars than the USA, Japan, and India collectively. The 6-minute video of the automobile manufacturing “needle” shows how the foreign manufacturing dominance occurred over the that 69-year period.

Automobiles manufactured per year.

Bringing those foreign built cars to America may be an insurmountable insurance problem. The Felicity Ace, a 650-foot-long cargo ship carrying hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of luxury cars sunk in March 2022. The salvage crew working on the burning ship said electric-vehicle batteries were part of the reason it was still aflame after several days. The estimated market value of the Felicity Ace was $24.5 million, while the total value of the 3965 vehicles could be over $500 million.

With potential fires from EV batteries, who’s going to take the insurance responsibility for their safe passage from the foreign manufacturers to American ports, the cargo ships, or the manufacturers?

With more than forty percent of the EV’s in America being in California at the end of 2020, the EV popularity in California has gotten California Governor Newsom so excited to that he issued an executive order to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035. The EV popularity in California inspired President Biden to want the rest of the country to follow California’s lead and issued a new executive order that pushes for half of all new cars sold in America by 2030 to be electric vehicles.

Even with the great California year-round weather, the states’ EV user’s experiences do not bode well for projected EV sales in America as the states’ EV users may be sending a caution-to-the-wind (no pun intended) message to America that the EV usage in the state reflects very conservative notices to future EV owners. A few reasons why Californians may be sending the wrong message to America are:

The limited usage of the EV’s of about 5,000 miles per year is a reflection that the EV is a second vehicle, for those that can afford a second vehicle, and not the family workhorse vehicle. The primary owners of EV’s are the highly educated and financially well off, and not representative of the majority that are middle to low income folks, or those on fixed incomes. EV owner incomes rank among the highest in the country which may be a reflection of home owners that have easier access to charging their EV from their multi-car garages, or for those folks living in new apartments that may have access to more convenient EV charging capabilities. Most car owners park in the street. According to ValuePenguin insurance, because electric vehicles cost more outright and are more expensive to repair, the average car insurance for an electric vehicle is about 23 percent more expensive than the cost for the equivalent combustion model. The ethnicity of Tesla owner’s skews toward Caucasians, at 87 percent. Owners who identify with Hispanic ethnicity make up 8 percent of Tesla owners, leaving 5 percent to other ethnicities. In California, the state with almost half the EV’s in the entire country, from that limited elite ownership group, there is a growing percentage of those California EV users that are switching back to gasoline cars, which is sending a message that may further deflate EV growth projections.

As Pew Research reported in June, “In each of the past three years, EVs accounted for about 2% of the U.S. new-car market.” In 2020, EV sales totaled 252,548, less than 3 percent of the 14,240, 548 passenger and light trucks sold. The reasons why EVs aren’t grabbing consumers by the tailpipe are many, but the main ones are affordability, charging and range functionality, and the possible exposure to inclement weather.

Another challenge for the EV growth is the EV charging dependence on intermittent electricity generated from breezes and sunshine. Adding EV charging loads onto the grid that is becoming more unstable is like putting salt in the wound. Power outages are now commonplace in California and Texas with more to follow throughout the nation as we adjust to a life dependent upon the time of day and the weather.

Until the current elite owners can demonstrate to the middle-income and those on fixed incomes that their EV’s are their primary family workhorse vehicles in all kinds of weather conditions, the less fortunate will most likely remain reluctant to buy into the EV evolution. Growing the supply chain for EV’s without a corresponding growth in demand, could be an economic disaster in the works.

Growing the supply chain in foreign countries for EV’s without a corresponding growth in demand or an effective way to transport via cargo ships those vehicles built in countries far removed from American ports, could be an economic disaster in the works.

Climate Change Poses No Existential Threat. Nada. Not Any.,H. Sterling Burnett,"A refreshing article in the Washington Examiner demonstrates what I have repeatedly said for more than a decade: climate change does not pose an “existential threat.” In fact, that’s the title of the article: “Climate change is not an ‘existential threat.'” In discussing the energy crisis that has arisen during Joe Biden’s brief tenure as president of the United States—primarily because of Biden’s climate policies—David Simon writes,

The Biden administration’s climate change policies have sharply increased oil prices, damaging the domestic economy and increasing the cost of nearly everything consumers buy. By increasing revenues for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime, they also made Russia stronger and more dangerous at a critical time, thus damaging national security. … But worst of all, the Biden administration’s basis for these policies, the claim that global warming presents an “existential threat,” is fraudulent. It is not based on any scientific consensus, and in fact, it ignores evidence of environmental benefits of global warming that offset its harm.

In this article, chock full of data, Simon schools so-called journalists in the corporate media on how to examine claims that humans are causing a climate catastrophe. Simon presents data and research that conclusively demonstrate temperature and climate-related deaths have significantly declined during the period of modern warming. Climate Realism has also pointed this out on numerous occasions, refuting alarmists’ claims to the contrary.

For example, arguably the largest study ever to examine excess mortality associated with temperature was published in the July 1 edition of The Lancet, one of the world’s most prominent health journals. The study’s authors, 68 scientists representing universities and research institutes in 33 countries spanning all regions of the world, came to two clear conclusions: cold temperatures contribute to far more deaths each year than warmer temperatures, and deaths associated with extreme temperatures, hot or cold, are declining. The researchers found nearly 10 times more people die due to cold temperatures than hot temperatures. Moreover, as global temperatures modestly increase, the number of people dying because of suboptimal temperatures is decreasing.

“Importantly, cold-related death decreased 0.51 per cent from 2000 to 2019, while heat-related death increased 0.21 per cent, leading to a reduction in net mortality due to cold and hot temperatures,” the study reports.

Considering that 10 times more people were dying from cold than from heat, the study indicates the warming between 2000 and 2019 saved 3.1 million lives from cold-related deaths, at the expense of just 130,000 extra deaths caused by heat. As a result, global warming saved a net of nearly three million lives during the past 20 years.

This study confirms what previous research has consistently shown. In 2015, for example, The Lancet published the results of another large-scale temperature/mortality study, in which the researchers found cold weather directly or indirectly killed 1,700 percent more people than warm or hot weather. The scientists examined health data from 384 locations in 13 countries, accounting for more than 74 million deaths. The authors of this study wrote,

[N]on-optimum ambient temperature is responsible for substantial excess in mortality, with important differences between countries. Although most previous research has focused on heat-related effects, most of the attributable deaths were caused by cold temperatures. Despite the attention given to extreme weather events, most of the effect happened on moderately hot and moderately cold days, especially moderately cold days.

Even The New York Times acknowledged the importance of that study, with Jane Brody writing, “Over time, as global temperatures rise, milder winter temperatures are likely to result in fewer cold-related deaths, a benefit that could outweigh a smaller rise in heat-caused mortality.”

In addition to correcting the record on heat-related deaths, Simon dismantles various climate fictions about worsening natural disasters, using readily available data:

The facts regarding natural disasters also do not support the “existential threat” claim. The number of hurricanes per year, a 2021 EPA report shows, has not increased since the late 19th century. Moreover, although you wouldn’t know it from the panicky, sensationalized news coverage, the total acreage burnt by forest fires annually has decreased, and most rivers flood less today than they used to. Since 1920, Earth’s average temperature has risen by 1.12 degrees and the world population has quadrupled from less than two billion to almost eight billion. Even so, the number of people killed each year by natural disasters has declined by about 90 percent. That statistic, more than any other, puts the lie to claims of an existential crisis due to climate. There is also the global air pollution death rate, which has declined by about 45 percent over the last three decades. Again, no “existential threat” here.

Simon is correct. Research published at Climate Realism has refuted assertions about worsening wildfires and hurricanes on multiple occasions.

Simon also discusses research showing the positive side of climate change: “global warming has increased both agricultural yields and growth of forests, grasslands, and tree leaves.”

Climate Change Weekly and Climate Realism have refuted claims climate change is a threat to crop production more than 100 times. We have cited research and hard data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization showing regional and global crop production and crop yields have regularly, almost yearly, set new records during the recent period of modern warming.

Basic agronomy explains why crop production is booming under current climate conditions. As detailed by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change in Climate Change Reconsidered: Biological Impacts and Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels, the carbon dioxide humans have been pumping into the air since the middle of the twentieth century has enriched plant growth and improved plants’ water-use efficiency, thereby contributing to record crop yields.

Laboratory experiments and real-world field research show as carbon dioxide increases, plant fitness and flower pollination improve, plants develop more-extensive root systems to extract greater amounts of nutrients from even poor-quality soil, plants use water more efficiently by reducing the number and openness of stomata through which they lose moisture during transpiration, and plants produce greater amounts of natural substances that repel insects and fight off competing weeds.

All of this has helped bring about the largest decline in hunger, malnutrition, and starvation in human history.

Simon’s conclusion is spot-on and speaks for itself:

Biden administration climate change policies are sensationalizing the threats while ignoring all the benefits. They rely on speculative “models” that supposedly project global temperatures and predict disasters. But these models are highly unreliable, … unable even to reproduce the temperature changes of the 20th century. The Biden administration’s campaign against U.S. oil production and pipelines is not just harmful—it is an environmental fraud.

To quote longtime radio host Paul Harvey, that’s “the rest of the story”: the very good news the mainstream media and various scientific and political shills aren’t telling you about climate change.

INDIAN SUBCONTINENT’S CLIMATE DOMINATED BY NATURAL FACTORS … AUSTRALIAN COURT DETERMINES NO CLIMATE DUTY OF CARE OWED TO CHILDREN

INDIAN SUBCONTINENT’S CLIMATE DOMINATED BY NATURAL FACTORS

A new book from the academic publisher Elsevier examines the factors that drive weather conditions, particularly the all-important monsoon seasons that affect the billions of people living in and around the Indian subcontinent. Monsoon rains bring periodic destruction and support regional agricultural production.

With contributions from more than 60 researchers and scientists across 23 chapters, the book examines the factors that drive, contribute to, or influence monsoons on seasonal, annual, decadal, and longer-term scales, both in the “big picture” and in minute detail.

The book indicates all evidence suggests short, medium, and long term monsoons patterns are dominated by nature. If climate change has any effect, it hasn’t been definitively measured or identified thus far.

Looking ahead, the book shows climate model simulations of future negative changes in seasonal monsoon timing and severity tied to human greenhouse gas emissions all flow from RCP 8.5 model runs, which are impossible to obtain because of the limits of available fossil fuels. This and other factors have definitively discredited RCP 8.5 in the literature, so it is unclear why some chapter authors use its simulations to forecast possible future monsoon trends in and around the Indian subcontinent.

The overall consensus of the book is that the primary factors driving seasonal monsoon rains are shifts of various natural teleconnections along different time scales. Teleconnections are recurrent and persistent large-scale patterns of pressure and circulation anomalies. The patterns responsible for monsoon frequency, severity, stability, and duration overlap include global, regional, and localized oceanic and atmospheric anomalies. These include the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO), El Nino and La Nina oscillations (ENSO), Eurasian snowfall trends, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and others.

Any measurable anthropogenic forcing affecting monsoon patterns has yet to be discovered.

The view of the authors of the book’s chapters on climate models is summed up fairly well in this statement from Chapter 1:

Despite the improvements in [General Circulation Models] over the last two decades, the quality of their prediction of ISM (Indian Summer Monsoon), especially in its operational mode, is still a matter of debate. The dynamical prediction skill originates mainly from the fact that monsoon strength is tightly linked to teleconnections. Current couple models have limited skills in predicting teleconnections to ISM.

In Chapter 18, the authors observe that among the third generation of climate models only two of the 38 accurately describe the established relationship between ISM and the AMO. The fifth generation of models (CMIP5) does only slightly better, and their projections of the ISM/AMO teleconnections are all over the map. The CMIP 5 models are incapable of modelling or only weakly model the known (observed) relationship between the AMO and changes in the tropical Pacific region and shifts in sea surface temperature anomalies, the authors explain.

The authors of Chapter 20 find climate models don’t agree on what kinds of changes in the ISM one might expect from anthropogenic forcing:

[T]here has been no consensus among modelling studies on either the past change or the projections of the future change of the [ENSO-ISM] teleconnection. [A]nalyzing CMIP5 model simulations … showed that natural variability plays a dominant role in decadal ENSO-ISM teleconnection during the twentieth century.

Although climate models forecast some monsoon pattern changes going forward in the twenty-first century, the changes are based on multiple model runs from the discredited RCP 8.5 extreme emissions scenarios. The RCP 8.5 simulations don’t produce consistent projections that rise above “noise,” or natural background fluctuations in the climate in the region. The authors state the “ENSO-ISM relation during the twentieth and twenty-first century shows no robust change in the sense that most of the models agree on the sign of change, leaving us with inconclusive results.”

In short, this book catalogs what is known and what remains unknown about the global, regional, and local teleconnections that drive the Indian summer monsoons, and it concludes any anthropogenic impact on monsoons is swamped by natural factors, as far as can be determined and reasonably expected.

AUSTRALIAN COURT DETERMINES NO CLIMATE DUTY OF CARE OWED TO CHILDREN

A unanimous Australian Federal Court ruling found the nation’s government does not have an enforceable duty of care to protect young people from harm from climate change, when assessing fossil fuel projects or other government actions that might result in greenhouse gas emissions.

The ruling overturned an earlier win by a group of eight youths who brought a class action on behalf of all Australian children, in which Justice Mordecai Bromberg ruled the government did have a common-law duty of care.

Although the federal court did not dispute climate change is occurring or that it may pose serious harm to humanity, the court ruled existing Australian law establishes no such duty of care. Chief Justice James Allsop wrote in his decision, “allowing the ‘duty of care’ ruling to stand would have required changes to government policy, [an action] that should be left to the government itself, not the courts.”

Dominion’s Deception Hits New High with Offshore Wind,David Wojick,"I recently published a Study done for CFACT, titled “Dominion’s VCEA Compliance Plan is Disastrously Unreliable”. The study is summarized in my article “How and why Dominion and other utilities lie” at https://www.cfact.org/2022/02/23/how-and-why-dominion-and-other-utilities-lie/.

The great deception is that Dominion proposes to build a huge amount of wind and solar generating capacity, together with retiring all of its fossil fueled generators, with almost none of the enormous storage capacity that is required to make the renewables viable.

This proposed long term Plan does not work and Dominion knows that, but in the short run they can make billions in profit by building the unreliable wind and solar. The disastrous unreliability only shows up in the long run

Now Dominion has topped that long term deception with a bigger short term one. They have applied for approval of a gigantic offshore wind power project. This is the beginning of the con described in my study.

The proposed project consists of 176 monster wind machines, each with a generating capacity of 14.7 MW, which is as big as giant windmills come. Each is over 1.5 times as high as the Washington monument. The total capacity is roughly 2,600 MW. As pointed out, there is no storage capacity to make this intermittent power reliably available, so the power will just come and go with the wind.

Dominion’s proposal has two very specific (and very big) deceptions. The engineering is secret and the published cost estimate is preposterously low.

Secret engineering

The first deception has to do with the engineering data needed to assess the project’s viability. There isn’t any! I am not making this up.

To be sure there is a voluminous set of documents called the “Generation Appendix” that no doubt provides lots of engineering analysis. But the entire corpus is classified “extraordinarily sensitive” and so is not available for analysis.

The stated reason for this wholesale secrecy is that Dominion got some bids for the project. Maybe for the machines, or the construction, or something else. We are not told, but apparently not revealing these bids is deemed so vital that all of the engineering is secret.

My personal interest is in the hurricane analysis, which should not involve bid amounts. Offshore wind has been developed almost entirely where they do not get hurricanes, while offshore Virginia is hurricane alley. Every year a lot of storms make the turn and run up the coast, including really powerful ones.

I happen to have a background in failure mode analysis and I am skeptical that these monster towers can be made hurricane proof. In fact there was a study a few years back that predicted significant hurricane damage to offshore US windmills. When there is this degree of potential for catastrophe, it is standard engineering practice to have the proposed design checked by independent engineers.

Then too, Dominion has had two huge 12 MW test machines on site for some time now. We would like to see that data, which has nothing to do with any bids for the main project.

While those parties admitted to the quasi-judicial Virginia approval process can challenge a wholesale sensitivity claim of this magnitude, it seems none has done so. The public can comment on the proceeding but these comments have no standing. The ratepayers are left in the dark.

It is ridiculous that the engineering for a project of this great scope, novelty and danger should be done in secret. This secrecy is a wholesale form of deception.

Preposterously low LCOE

At the other extreme we have a single public cost estimate, which plays a pivotal role in the approval process. How this estimate was derived is part of the secret engineering. The problem is that the number itself is preposterous.

The magic number is called the “levelized cost of electricity” or simply the LCOE. This number is widely used in the industry so its nature is well established. It is the entire life cycle cost of the power generator and its generation divided by the amount of power generated in that generator’s life. The standard units of measure are dollars per megawatt-hour.

Note that the included costs run from engineering and construction, through operation, maintenance and repair, to shut down and decommissioning, which may include removal. New transmission capacity is also included and this project is 27 miles out to sea.

Obviously, when a project has not been built the LCOE is just an engineering estimate, with lots of assumptions.

Here is the catch. The Dominion offshore project is being built pursuant to the strangely named and very green Virginia Clean Economy Act. In this case LCOE plays an unusually pivotal role. Normally the approval of huge projects like this is up to the state’s electric power regulator. But the VCEA says that as long as the LCOE stays below a certain threshold, approval is automatic. So the LCOE is very important.

This is where is gets truly strange. Dominion says the automatic approval threshold is staying under $125/MWh and while I cannot replicate that I will accept it for now. What I cannot accept is Dominion’s claim that this monster offshore project has a LCOE of just $73/MWh, which is way below the threshold so meets it handily.

The reason for my skepticism is simple. The US Energy Information Administration tracks LCOEs for different types of generators. Its present estimated average for offshore wind is a whopping $118/MWh. This is 60% higher than the Dominion estimate! It is also very close to the threshold value.

In fact the EIA estimate may be low. Last year the procurement cost for a major US offshore wind project was announced at $96/MWh. That is just procurement so it does not include life cycle O&M, repair and replacement, or decommissioning and removal. In particular, removal of the underwater foundations could be very expensive.

In summary, all this secrecy is wrong. The rate payers and the public have a right to know what is going on with this project. Dominion’s claim that all of the project engineering is “extraordinarily sensitive” is ridiculous. This claim should be challenged and rejected.

Dominion’s extremely low LCOE needs to be investigated. It is certainly possible that the correct value exceeds the threshold for automatic approval. In fact Dominion recently announced a 20% increase in the project cost and prices are still going up.

Show us the engineering.

House Democrats Cancel Looming Embarassment,Paul Driessen,"Mike Tyson once observed, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.

March 8 was to be anti-oil Democrats’ big day. Having pilloried (weak-kneed) Big Oil executives during two previous hearings over supposed climate change prevention failures, House Oversight Committee leaders had planned to really tighten the thumbscrews.

At their October 2021 hearing, committee chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and chief inquisitor Ro Khanna (D-CA) insisted that Big Oil commit to reducing US oil and gas production by 3-4% annually (50-70% total by 2050). Otherwise, they claimed, global temperatures will rise 1.5 degrees Celsius (calculated from the end of the Little Ice Age and beginning of the Industrial Revolution, both around 1850) – which “the science” says would be an “existential threat” to Planet Earth.

“I don’t need” an “American apple pie speech” about “meeting the needs of society,” Mr. Khanna told ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods. Will Exxon reduce production? Yes or no? the congressman demanded.

During the February 8, 2022 hearing, the two legislators demanded that oil companies “live up to” the “climate pledges” they have made. Shell and BP, they said, have promised to go net-zero on all their greenhouse gas emissions. However, ExxonMobil and Chevron pledges apply only to emissions associated with drilling and production operations.

That is completely inadequate, Maloney and Khanna argued. Not only do these two American companies not “plan to reduce their oil production by a single drop.” Their pledge ignores the “whopping 90%” of emissions that come from consumers burning the fuels they produce. The pledges and legislators also ignore emissions from China, India and other countries, which dwarf US emissions many times over.

The two companies should have diversified into “clean renewable” energy. That’s how they can lower people’s heating bills and prices at the pump, and climate-killing emissions, the legislators suggested.

Of course, Mr. Khanna added, in a sudden about-face, he supports President Biden’s “decisive actions” to help lower gas prices,” by asking OPEC, Saudi Arabia and Russia to increase oil production and “calling on all oil companies to temporarily increase production.” (Foreign oil doesn’t emit greenhouse gases?)

The legislators promised to hold a third hearing on March 8, when they would interrogate oil company executives “under oath,” “aggressively investigate” the industry’s role in fueling “the climate crisis,” and demand that oil companies “stop funding climate disinformation.” The March hearing would be Big Oil’s “last chance to cooperate” with Congress, Ms. Maloney warned ominously.

Enter Mike Tyson, in the form of skyrocketing energy and food prices – and bullets and missiles flying in Ukraine. The chairwoman abruptly canceled the inquisition mere days before it was to be held. She and her Democrat colleagues clearly didn’t want to be humiliated by unfolding events and the grilling they would likely receive from Republicans, witnesses and their constituents. Realities can be troublesome.

Even as post-Covid demand surged in an America and world that still rely on oil, gas and coal for 80% of their energy, Congressional Democrats, the White House, federal agencies and activist groups worked in consort to cancel pipelines, impose leasing and drilling moratoriums, slow-walk permits, and pressure financial institutions to stymie funding for oil and gas operations.

As they choked off production and supplies, oil, natural gas and gasoline prices nearly doubled during Mr. Biden’s first year in office. The price of food and nearly all consumer products and services soared in response. Salaries are being hammered by inflation. Consumers (aka voters) voiced their outrage.

Then Russian forces invaded Ukraine, slaughtering civilians and sending millions fleeing to neighboring countries. President Biden continued importing 670,000 barrels of Putin crude oil and refined products every day. Gasoline hit $7 per gallon in some cities the day the hearing was to be held.

Finally, right when the congressional inquisition would have been underway, Mr. Biden finally issued an executive order banning imports of Russian crude oil, refined products and natural gas. Congress signaled it might codify the ban into law. Global oil prices shot to $110 per barrel.

The President could have told his federal regulators to get agency boots off the necks of American exploration, production and pipeline companies – and start expediting permits. He could have told climate activists, banks and financial institutions to pause their war on fossil fuels.

Instead, he’s still trying to persuade Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Putin ally Venezuela to increase their oil production, to keep prices from skyrocketing further. He’s still using Russia to broker a new nuclear deal with Iran, thereby permitting the Islamist regime to sell more oil on the global market!

Amid cries of “Putin Price Hikes,” the Biden Administration and congressional Democrats continue to obsess over the “climate crisis” and promote a rapid “transition” to “renewable” energy.

It’s an exercise in distraction and magical thinking. Wind and sunshine are certainly clean and renewable. However, harnessing this widely dispersed, weather-dependent energy to meet huge and growing US and global energy needs requires millions of wind turbines, billions of solar panels, billions of battery modules and thousands of miles of new transmission lines that need enormous quantities of metals and minerals, which are absolutely not clean, renewable or sustainable.

Indeed, just Mr. Biden’s initial 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind energy would require 110,000 tons of copper – plus massive amounts of cobalt, lithium, nickel, aluminum, steel, rare earth elements and other materials. Getting just the copper would require mining 25 million tons of ore. But federal bureaucrats and judges have already shut down three proposed U.S. copper mines. Again, that’s just the copper.

How many tons of metals, minerals, ores and overburden will be required overall for wind turbines, solar panels, battery modules, transformers and transmission lines in an all-electricity Green New Deal economy? How much fossil fuel energy to do all this work? Where will the mining, processing and manufacturing take place? (Alaska, California and Colorado? Or China, Russia and Africa?)

How much environmental destruction, and child and slave labor, will be involved? What will these materials cost, as demand surges? How much land and wildlife will be impacted by the mining, factories, and industrial wind, solar and battery installations as far as the eye can see?

Green New Dealers don’t have a clue, and don’t care. They also figure they will be exempted from the “inconveniences.” We will be the ones paying. We ought to care. The amounts are truly mind-boggling. For clues about the almost unfathomable impacts and costs, look here, here, here, here and here.

Europe and the United States already have minimal leverage (and credibility) over China and Russia on diplomatic matters, territorial ambitions – or open warfare. The vaunted Green New Deal would likely make America almost totally reliant on Chinese and Russian companies for “renewable” energy materials.

Media, academia and federal agencies are already populated by anti-fossil-fuel stalwarts. But making matters worse, Putin cronies have long funded clandestine money laundering operations to finance major disinformation campaigns by US and EU environmentalist groups, to undermine drilling, fracking and pipeline programs. The US Senate “Billionaires’ Club” report, Environmental Policy Alliance’s “From Russia with Love” analysis, articles by investigative journalists Ron Arnold and Lachlan Markay (here and here), and studies by the US National Intelligence Director and US House Science Committee provide extensive, disturbing details that Democrats in Congress and the Administration have ignored.

The Ukraine invasion is prompting renewed attention to these nefarious activities benefitting the Sea Change Foundation, Sierra Club, Climate Action Network, NRDC and other groups.

The Maloney-Khanna Oversight Committee should investigate these money laundering and Green New Deal mining, cost and ecological issues – and leave the “climate crisis” and “price-gouging” fantasies to Hollywood horror and conspiracy movies. But don’t hold your breath.

Democrats Can’t Solve Energy-Related Problems Because They Don’t Understand They Are Causing Them,H. Sterling Burnett,"With oil prices topping $125.00 per barrel and gasoline prices averaging $4.17 per gallon nationwide for regular as I write, the White House and Democrats in Congress persist in the delusion that the economy can rapidly transition completely to green energy.

Their belief that wind, solar, batteries, and electric vehicles can effectively and cheaply power the nation while ending the use of energy sources that emit greenhouse gases in their use is foolish and belied by the evidence. Biden et al. are so obsessed with the vain idea that they can control the weather 100 years from now that even a war, ongoing pandemic, rapidly rising inflation, and economic and geopolitical perils looming around the world won’t make them reconsider their ongoing war on fossil fuels.

Therein lies the problem. The first step to getting out of a hole is to stop digging. This is especially true if the hole is one you dug yourself. As applied to America’s energy situation, Biden and the Democrats have put us in a hole, and they won’t stop digging. They can’t solve America’s current energy and energy-driven inflation problems if they don’t understand the source of the problems is, in fact, the energy policies they’ve imposed on the nation.

Biden finally caved in to growing bipartisan political pressure and agreed to ban Russian oil. In doing so, he admits this will further raise prices in the United States. I cheer this gesture as morally correct even though it is largely futile. We should not be helping fund Russian aggression, but we should also be savvy enough to recognize this action will have little or no impact on Russia’s budget or its ability to wage war and will have a significant impact on the United States, and in Europe should its governments follow suit.

Oil is a fungible commodity, traded on world markets. Unless the ban is global, Russia will just sell its oil to willing buyers in China, India, North Korea, and wherever else oil demand is high and people are not so choosy about it origins—at a discount price if necessary.

Which brings us back to the United States. Oil prices began a steep ascent shortly after Biden became president, long before the Ukraine war began. This was caused in part by the reopening of the economy after the pandemic. However, as detailed in a recent report from The Heartland Institute, the most important factor driving higher oil and gas prices has been the series of anti-fossil-fuel measures implemented by the Biden administration. Heartland’s analysis found the average American household spent $1,000 more on energy costs in 2021 than the year prior, largely because of Biden’s energy policies.

Biden and company fail to understand the basic fact that their climate policies are producing the high prices and shortages apparent across the U.S. economy and their boosting of oil prices increased the funding for Putin’s war machine.

Biden’s response to high oil prices in his State of the Union address was to dig deeper into the hole, doubling down on the failed energy policies that put us in the current crisis.

“Let’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy-efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more; lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.” Biden said.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki’s tone-deaf response to high energy prices was to tweet, “Production is up, rising, and approaching records, yet Russia’s actions still leave our consumers vulnerable. It’s a reminder that real energy security comes from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.”

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) showed complete ignorance of America’s energy dependence on Russia, at a recent press conference. In response to a reporter asking, “What do you make of Sen. Manchin’s proposal to have more domestic oil production?” Schumer replied, “The U.S. is a major oil producer; we only get 1 percent of any imports from Russia.” Schumer was flat wrong! Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows U.S. oil imports from Russia grew to more than 8 percent of all imported oil in 2021, during Biden’s first year in office.

The same EIA report revealed oil imports from Russia to the United States in 2021 grew by more than 24 percent from the last year of Donald Trump’s presidency. Oil imports from Russia in 2021 exceeded the oil imported from Russia in each of Trump’s four years in office, and they were approximately 79 percent greater than the amount imported during the lowest-volume year recorded under Trump.

The plain fact is, the amount of oil that would have been shipped daily through the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada, 850,000 barrels per day, could have more than supplanted all the oil imported from Russia daily, had Biden not cancelled its permits on his first day in office.

Donald Trump understood energy issues. He correctly saw climate change as something manageable and recognized fossil fuels remain critical for economic progress. Trump charted a course not just for American energy independence but energy dominance, with his policies making us a net energy exporter for the first time since the 1950s. Biden has been reversing these policies as fast as he can sign orders between naps.

Republicans understand the problem. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and other Senate and House Republicans are offering bills to rescind the executive actions Biden has imposed to prevent pipeline development and delay new oil and gas exploration and production. The congressional Democrats say these bill won’t see the light of day as long as they are in control. The Democratic leadership doesn’t get it. Because they don’t get it, they may not be in control of Congress much longer.

The energy and space entrepreneur and social media darling Elon Musk gets it. Despite leading the largest, most successful electric vehicle manufacturer in the world, Tesla—a company that benefits from higher oil and gas prices—Musk recently called for increasing U.S. oil and gas production.

“Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil and gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures,” Musk tweeted to his nearly 63 million Twitter followers. “Obviously, this would negatively affect Tesla, but sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil and gas exports.”

In calling for increased oil and gas production, Musk is putting the nation’s well-being ahead of his self-interest. He’s an energy realist. In this climate-woke day and age, that makes him a both a champion of reason and a patriot.

Democrats deny energy reality. What that makes them, I’ll let the reader decide, but in my opinion it paints them as fools or traitors.

The cartoon character Pogo’s famous statement, “We have met the enemy, and he is us,” was meant to be humorous. His quip has rarely captured a political situation more aptly than with the high prices Americans face today because of Biden’s climate and energy policies. It’s not funny at all.

This can be remedied over the course of the next two election cycles, though sooner would be better.

IPCC Report Misrepresents Climate Data … Antarctic Sea Ice Is Consistently Expanding Amidst Warming … Nature, Not Human Emissions, Still Rules Arctic Ocean Warming

IPCC REPORT MISREPRESENTS CLIMATE DATA

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) newest report, released the first week of March, is short on facts and long on horror stories based on extreme climate model scenarios, according to fact-checking by outside sources such as meteorologist Anthony Watts, University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr., and others.

The final sentence of the IPCC report sums up the claims made in the body of the document in stark, fashion: “The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well-being and the health of the planet. Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.”

There is no evidence whatsoever that climate change threatens human survival or even long-term economic progress. The IPCC provides no data to back up its predictions of impending doom. Instead, as Watts notes, the IPCC’s doomsday claims rely on climate models that have been discredited in the scientific literature, such as RCP 8.5. There simply isn’t enough fossil fuel in existence on the planet to bring about RCP 8.5. Economist Richard Tol, a member of Academia Europea (the European equivalent of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences), writes, “They could either pretend that RCP 8.5 is fine, or ignore most of the literature.” Denying physical reality and the substantial body of literature that debunks RCP 8.5 is the course the IPCC chose.

Among the egregious claims made in the recent report are assertions about sea level rise. Pielke shows the IPCC’s sea level claims are refuted by the IPCC’s own data in the scientific report issued in August:

The report concludes (TS-31) with high confidence that “Flood risks and societal damages are projected to increase with every increment of global warming.” This is simply not true. And by “not true” I mean that it is not an accurate representation of the literature that WG2 [working group 2] cites to justify this claim. It is also empirically false, as vulnerability to floods has dramatically decreased even as the planet has warmed.

This IPCC report portrays people and nations as living solely at the whims of nature, with no ability to minimize the climate’s effect on us or respond effectively to weather extremes and changing climate conditions. Pielke calls this portrayal a “bizzaro world” because it is the opposite of human history, which demonstrates humans are adaptable and human societies are resilient. Humans apply ingenuity and technology to climate conditions, to shape it in ways that limit the impact climate has on their lives and lifestyles and thereby increase human lifespans, improve human health, and enhance well-being.

ANTARCTIC SEA ICE IS CONSISTENTLY EXPANDING AMIDST WARMING

New research published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature reports sea ice extent has grown fairly consistently during the current period of modest global warming.

The team of geographers and statisticians from the University of Ohio-Athens and UCLA reports, “In stark contrast to the Arctic, there have been statistically significant positive trends in total Antarctic sea ice extent since 1979.”

The researchers created a comprehensive, robust dataset of observations to reconstruct Antarctic sea ice extent by season since 1905. They found,

Using these reconstructions, here we show that the observed period since 1979 is the only time all four seasons demonstrate significant increases in total Antarctic sea ice in the context of the twentieth century and that the observed increases are juxtaposed against statistically significant decreases throughout much of the early and middle twentieth century. These reconstructions provide reliable estimates of seasonally resolved total Antarctic sea ice extent and are skillful enough to better understand aspects of air–sea–ice interactions within the Antarctic climate system.

To be clear, climate model simulations have consistently projected Antarctic sea ice should have declined during the recent period of warming, whereas the data, based on observed measurements, show just the opposite has occurred. During the period of warming in the latter decades of the twentieth century and the first two decades of the twenty-first, average Antarctic sea ice has consistently expanded, regardless of the season. In Antarctica, it seems, nature, not human activities, still controls the climate.

NATURE, NOT HUMAN EMISSIONS, STILL RULES ARCTIC OCEAN WARMING

New research published in the scientific journal Nature Communications indicates natural atmospheric and oceanic cycles are responsible for a significant amount of recent warming experienced in the Arctic Ocean. Human greenhouse gas emissions have been only one contributor, possibly even a secondary factor.

A team of researchers from the Earth Research Institute at the University of California-Santa Barbara and the Polar Science Center at the University of Washington-Seattle compared upper ocean temperature records in the Arctic to measurements of changes in atmospheric and oceanic cycles and temperatures. They then ran computer model simulations to determine the extent to which recent Arctic warming corresponded with or was driven by atmospheric and wider oceanic changes. They write,

[W]e demonstrate that a multiyear trend in the summertime large-scale atmospheric circulation, which we ascribe to internal variability, has played an important role in upper ocean warming in summer and fall over the past four decades due to sea ice-albedo effect induced by atmospheric dynamics. … [E]xperiments in which the wind fields are constrained toward the observed state support this mechanism and suggest that the internal variability contribution to recent upper Arctic Ocean warming accounts for up to one quarter of warming over the past four decades and up to 60 percent of warming from 2000 to 2018.

This research means attributing the recent warming of the Arctic Ocean primarily to human-caused climate change based on climate model assumptions and greenhouse gas emission scenarios is wrong. Natural atmospheric and oceanic changes account for as much as 60 percent of the warming of the Arctic Ocean and sea ice decline in recent decades. The research team concludes “climate models need to replicate this important internal process in order to realistically simulate Arctic Ocean temperature variability and trends” if they are to be useful in projecting future climate conditions.

Biden’s ‘We Are Going To Get Rid Of Fossil Fuels’ Is A Primary Cause For Shortages And Inflation,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","A year before being inaugurated President in 2021, Biden professed that “we are going to get rid of fossil fuels.

Before Biden assumed office, America was in pretty good shape, having achieved energy independence:

For the first time since Harry Truman was president about 70 years ago, the United States was a net energy exporter, to finally become crude oil independent and no longer held hostage to unstable Petro-powers and the vagaries of foreign crude oil supplies.

The United States was the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.

The United States was a net natural gas exporter for three consecutive years and had an export capacity of nearly 10 billion cubic feet per day

The Trump administration had withdrawn from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Agreement

The Trump administration had approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines

The Trump administration opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska to oil and gas leasing

The Trump administration had reformed permitting rules to eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy and speed approval for mines

The Trump administration fixed the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) steam electric and coal ash rules

The average American family saved $2,500 a year in lower electric bills and lower prices at the gas pump

The Trump administration reduced the time to approve drilling permits on public lands by half, increasing permit applications to drill on public lands by 300 percent

The Trump administration expedited approval of the NuStar’s New Burgos pipeline to export American gasoline to Mexico

The Trump administration streamlined liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal permitting and allowed long-term LNG export authorizations to be extended through 2050

The United States was among the top three LNG exporters in the world

The United States increased LNG exports five-fold since January 2017, reaching an all-time high in January 2020

LNG exports were expected to reduce the American trade deficit by over $10 billion

The Trump administration granted more than 20 new long-term approvals for LNG exports to non-free trade agreement countries

The development of natural gas and LNG infrastructure in the United States was providing tens of thousands of jobs and led to the investment of tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure

There were 6 LNG export facilities operating in the United States, with 2 additional export projects under construction

The amount of nuclear energy production in 2019 was the highest on record, through a combination of increased capacity from power plant upgrades and shorter refueling and maintenance cycles

The Trump administration prevented Russian energy coercion across Europe through various lines of effort, including the Partnership for Transatlantic Energy Cooperation, civil nuclear deals with Romania and Poland, and opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline

The Trump administration issued the Presidential Permit for the A2A railroad between Canada and Alaska, providing energy resources to emerging markets

Biden bought into the messages from a Russian funded environmental group that gave millions to anti-fracking groups to stop, curtail or severely weaken U.S. fracking of crude oil and natural gas in states like Texas, North Dakota, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Pennsylvania by implementing multiple restrictions on domestic oil production. America will be discouraging U.S. energy independence, starting with tightening restrictions on fossil fuel development by suspending Federal Oil and Gas Permits, encouraging the shuttering, and halting of further fracking efforts in America.

The unintended consequences of Biden attempting to rid America and the world of crude oil usage are being realized in supply shortages and soaring prices resulting from the reduction in the quantity of products and fuels manufactured from crude oil that support:

Asphalt for roughly 65 million miles of roads in the world

Tires for the 1.4 billion vehicles in the world

Fertilizers to feed the world on this increasingly resource-stretched and crowded earth.

Medical supplies that are primarily made from oil derivatives

Jets that comprise more than 50,000 for military, commercial, private, and the Presidents Air Force One

Merchant ships that comprise more than 53,000 that move products throughout the world

Vehicles that are mostly made of plastics

Renewables of wind turbines and solar panels that are made from oil derivatives

The decarbonization efforts of the Green New Deal (GND) are well under way attempting to utilize unreliable breezes and sunshine to replace 2 of the fossil fuels – coal and natural gas – that have been used for generating continuous uninterruptible electricity, but crude oil is in a class by itself.

While breezes and sunshine, i.e., renewables continue to underperform in the generation of electricity, the innocent bystander of crude oil, that is seldom used for electricity, continues to be targeted for elimination along with coal and natural gas.

Crude oil is seldom ever used for electricity generation, but somewhere along the line, crude oil got caught on the chopping block efforts to eliminate ALL 3 fossil fuels.

Today, Biden supports allowing banks and investment giants to collude to reshape economies and energy infrastructure with their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels. ESG is a very dangerous precedent as the American people never voted to give banks this sort of control over our country.

The hydrocarbon processing industry, i.e., refineries, have a rich history of discovery, challenges, breakthroughs, trial and error, collaboration, and successes that have contributed to the world populating from 1 to 8 billion in less than 200 years.

Looking back a little more than 100 years, it’s easy to see how civilization has benefited from more than 250 leading-edge, hydrocarbon processing licensed refining technologies used by the more than 700 refineries worldwide that service the demands of the 8 billion living on earth with more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products were available to society before 1900.

It seems obvious that the efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to the civilization of 8 billion.

Biden’s attempts to attain a decarbonized world like the one that existed in the 1800’s and before, would result in billions of fatalities for the 8 billion on earth from disease, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths, versus the projections of millions of fatalities from climate change. Yes, billions without oil are greater than millions from climate changes.

Realistically, there are no silver bullet answers to save the entire 8 billion population of the world.

An abundance of crude oil, the same oil that contributed to the world populating from 1 to 8 billion in less than 200 years, leads to prosperity for all, while a restriction or lack of oil leads to economic struggle, poverty, shortages, and inflation to maintain current lifestyles and economies.

We’re Comparatively the Planet’s Cleanest Country – Why the Bipartisan Push to Tax Our Carbon?,Seton Motley,"The anti-United States World loves to compile its “World’s Cleanest Countries” lists – on which the US never appears. Here’s a Top 100 list for 2022 – on which we do not exist. You can imagine the number of slob nations that make this ridiculous cut. Russia is #52.

Of course, these idiotic lists are garbage in-garbage out. The list-makers get to decide what “pollution” is – and work backwards from there to exclude the US.

The US has the world’s largest economy – which requires the world’s largest energy supply. But by rate of energy use versus output of pollution, the United States is undoubtedly the cleanest country on the planet.

US Greenhouse Gas Emissions Drop Under Trump, but Climate Experts Aren’t Celebrating

Of course they aren’t. Because a cleaner planet isn’t their objective. A planet wiped clean of the US is.

China is #2 in Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Think they’re running clean?

China: World’s Biggest Polluter … and Climate Activist?:

“Its greenhouse gas emissions are more than the US and EU combined, but China has big ambitions for carbon neutrality.”

No: China SAYS they have “big ambitions for carbon neutrality.” If you believe them – you haven’t been paying very close attention.

Is the aforementioned Russia cleaning up its act? Heavens no. In 2020, they broke a 16-year-old air pollution record. And I’m sure things have only gotten cleaner since they invaded Ukraine.

India’s economy is rapidly expanding. But unlike US, it ain’t getting cleaner. Au contraire….

Deaths Linked to PM2.5 Pollution in India Increased by 2.5 Times in 2 Decades

Like China, Russia and India get worse and worse – while saying all sorts of things will one day get better and better. You know, to assuage the World.

The Latest Round of Global Climate Lie ‘Pledges’ From International Polluters

We here in the US should, by now, know global organizations exist solely to stick it to US. The United Nations? The World Health Organization? The International Telecommunications Union? The North Atlantic Treaty Organization? All of these and more exist to take potshots at the US – and make the US pay exorbitantly for the privilege.

We here in the US should, therefore, not promote domestic policies that comport with the World’s ridiculous anti-US perspective.

Unfortunately, not only do we have domestic Leftists and Democrats undercutting US – we have alleged Rightists and Republicans undercutting US.

On alleged pollution – the bipartisan “prescription” is a carbon tax imposed on US citizens and businesses.

Of course the Left wants it…

Path to Progressive Carbon Tax

Democrats Are Considering Adding a Carbon Tax to Massive Budget Bill

But for reasons that surpass understanding – some non-Leftists want it too.

Republican Carbon Tax Bills Keep Getting Better

Top Conservatives Already Back a Carbon Tax; It’s Time for Energy Producers to Follow Suit

Ummm…no, it’s not.

We’re about the only country actually improving our pollution levels. We’re certainly the only country with a major economy doing so.

Why would US citizens want to punish the US – and only the US – for being the only ones doing the right thing?

Finally, there is a bipartisan awakening to what is actually happening in the US – and the rest of the planet. And some in DC are looking to re-aim the carbon tax. Away from US – and at everyone else.

The Bipartisan Climate Solution:

“Momentum is building on both sides of the aisle to come up with a measure to penalize imports of high polluting goods, and lawmakers are taking a page out of former President Donald Trump’s book….

“‘It looks and feels a lot like Trump’s tariffs…’ Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) said.

“Republicans are eager to tackle competition with China, whose lax environmental standards often mean lower production prices, and create an ‘America-first’ climate policy.

“‘Donald Trump should love it,’ (Republican) Sen. Kevin Cramer said.'”

Because…duh…:

“‘What did Trump do? When you had unfair business practices that gave the other country an advantage over our businesses, he put a tariff on their product,’ Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has been engaging with Democrats on the issue, told Politico.

“‘Well, we are trying to move the world to a cleaner environment, and China, India and other countries are not doing as much, and they need to pay a price.'”

Yes, please.

Trump Trade Principles to Mitigate the Climate Alarmists and Their Many Taxes

Of course, much bipartisan stupidity remains…:

“(M)any Democrats and some free-market Republicans (still) want a domestic price on carbon….”

But at least there is now some crucial DC movement in the correct direction.

"For Texans and Australians it’s Breezes and Sunshine, or No Grid at All","Ronald Stein, P.E.","The Texans’ Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and Australians are constantly being blown away with the growing “nameplate” capacity of wind turbines and solar panels to provide electricity, but electricity from renewables have yet to produce anywhere near their projected capacity due to the intermittency and unreliability of breezes and sunshine.

No country on Earth relies entirely on wind and solar for all their electricity, but Texans and Australians politicians aim to achieve this miracle.

Without subsidies, the so-called wind and solar ‘industries’ for electricity from unreliable breezes and sunshine would disappear in a heartbeat. Two rules that supporters of this made-up industry follow vehemently are:

The first rule about the ‘inevitable’ wind and solar transition to intermittent electricity dependent on weather conditions is that you do not talk about the subsidies.

The second rule about the world’s greatest economic and environmental scam is that you DO NOT talk about the subsidies.

For those of us who focus on the costs and benefits of various kinds of power plants within a grid system, it appears there has been an orchestrated effort through media, advertising, and public relations – even government agencies – to mislead the public about the value proposition of wind and solar. “The duty cycle for intermittent renewable resources, wind and solar, is not operator controlled, but dependent on the weather or solar cycle (that is, sunrise/sunset)..(and so) their levelized costs are not directly comparable to those for other technologies..”

For all the hype and billions of dollars poured into solar and wind electricity, those breezes and sunshine still provide less than 5 per cent of the world’s electricity while oil, gas and coal make up about 80 per cent.

While renewables continue to underperform in the generation of electricity, the innocent bystander of crude oil that is seldom used for electricity, continues to be targeted for elimination along with coal and natural gas. Today, Biden supports allowing banks and investment giants to collude to reshape economies and energy infrastructure with their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels.

Merchant ships that comprise more than 53,000 that move products throughout the world

Vehicles that are mostly made of plastics

It seems obvious that the efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization. Attempting to attain a decarbonized world like the one that existed in the 1800’s and before, would result in Billions of fatalities for the 8 billion on earth from disease, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths, versus the projections of millions of fatalities from changes in climate.

Realistically, there are no silver bullet answers to save the entire 8 billion population of the world.

Texans and Australians must be reminded that crude oil processed at refineries provides societies and economies with the supply chain of oil derivatives, that are the foundation of more than 6,000 products that are the basis of lifestyles, and of manufactured fuels for the many of the heavy-weight and long-range needs of transportation infrastructures such as aircraft, cruise and merchant ships, and the military and space program.

For Texans and Australians that do not rely on nuclear for a continuous uninterruptable source of zero-emission electricity should be astonished that there are 30 countries where you’ll find nearly 450 nuclear reactors currently operating – including the French, Americans, Canadians, Japanese and Chinese. Another 15 countries are currently building 60 reactors among them. Nuclear power output accounts for over 11 percent of global electricity production.

The French have rebooted investment in their zero-emissions 56 existing nuclear plants and are planning a further 14 to add to their enviable fleet. The EU looks set to designate gas and nuclear power as “green energy”.

In Britain, Rolls-Royce has submitted designs for regulatory approval to install about a dozen small modular nuclear reactors (SMR’s) across the UK.

Canada has ordered SMRs – the smaller, more mobile, cheaper reactors that produce about a third of the power of traditional nuclear power plants – for 2028.

The Biden administration has allocated billions of dollars in its most recent budget to extend the life of more than 90 reactors that still provide 20 per cent of electricity supply in the US.

Texans and Australians need nuclear power not only to meet their ambitious zero-emissions targets but also to contribute to the U.S. and allied efforts to reassert scientific and technological leadership in nuclear power that rapidly is being lost to China.

The claim that nuclear power is unsafe, a legacy of accidents in the old, poorly run reactors at Chernobyl and Fukushima, still resonates, but since inception of nuclear generation of continuous uninterruptable zero-emission electricity decades ago, America’s fatalities from nuclear are ZERO. Yes, no one has ever died from a nuclear incident in America!

Unlike the growth of nuclear generation around the world, Texans and Australians continue their unhinged obsession with unreliable breezes and sunshine for their intermittent electricity and a ban on a safe source for continuous uninterruptable zero-emission electricity from nuclear.

And Texans and Australians are willing to incur the consequences of the elimination of products and fuels manufactured from crude oil that support today’s lifestyle and economies which promotes shortages and inflation for a reduction in the supply chain to meet the growing demands of society.

Do Wind Farms Change the Weather?,David Wojick,"The effect of lots of wind turbines on weather and climate is a small but active research area. Wind power converts wind energy into electricity, thereby removing that energy from the air.

The research issue of how taking a lot of energy out might affect weather or climate seems to have emerged as early as 2004. Studies range from the global climate impact down to the local effects of a single large wind facility.

Here is a nontechnical article on a key global climate scale paper in 2011: “Wind and wave farms could affect Earth’s energy balance“in New Scientist magazine, March 30, 2011. Must register to read here: https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028063-300-wind-and-wave-farms-could-affect-earths-energy-balance/

Here is the seminal technical paper: “Estimating maximum global land surface wind power extractability and associated climatic consequences” by L. M. Miller, F. Gans, and A. Kleidon; Earth System Dynamics, February 11, 2011. Article is open access here:

https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/2/1/2011/

This lengthy Abstract explains the physics:

“The availability of wind power for renewable energy extraction is ultimately limited by how much kinetic energy is generated by natural processes within the Earth system and by fundamental limits of how much of the wind power can be extracted. Here we use these considerations to provide a maximum estimate of wind power availability over land. We use several different methods. First, we outline the processes associated with wind power generation and extraction with a simple power transfer hierarchy based on the assumption that available wind power will not geographically vary with increased extraction for an estimate of 68 TW. Second, we set up a simple momentum balance model to estimate maximum extractability which we then apply to reanalysis climate data, yielding an estimate of 21 TW. Third, we perform general circulation model simulations in which we extract different amounts of momentum from the atmospheric boundary layer to obtain a maximum estimate of how much power can be extracted, yielding 18–34 TW. These three methods consistently yield maximum estimates in the range of 18–68 TW and are notably less than recent estimates that claim abundant wind power availability. Furthermore, we show with the general circulation model simulations that some climatic effects at maximum wind power extraction are similar in magnitude to those associated with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. We conclude that in order to understand fundamental limits to renewable energy resources, as well as the impacts of their utilization, it is imperative to use a “top-down” thermodynamic Earth system perspective, rather than the more common “bottom-up” engineering approach.”

Their conclusion at the end is that maximizing global wind development could have as big an effect on climate as the climate models give for doubling CO2, which is a lot. Thus if you took out all the energy possible by wind the climate effects might be big. And this is just for land based wind towers, so a lot of offshore wind should add to this effect.

The “related articles” section of this paper lists several earlier articles, as well as several discussing this paper. Also, Google Scholar lists 110 newer papers that cite this one, some of which are on the topic of the weather or climate impacts of energy removal by wind power. In addition, if you click on Google Scholar’s “Related articles” button you get another hundred papers, many of which are directly on the topic of wind power affecting weather and climate.

See https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=1&q=allintitle:+surface+wind+power+author:A+author:Kleidon&hl=en&as_sdt=0,49

Here is an example: “Regional climate model simulations indicate limited climatic impacts by operational and planned European wind farms” in Nature Communications, February 11, 2014.

See https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4196?origin=ppub#citeas

At the extreme end, wind proponent Mark Z. Jacobson has claimed that very large arrays of offshore wind turbines off the U.S. East Coast could actually remove enough atmospheric energy to reduce the damaging energy of major hurricanes. I am not making this up and I think he wants 300,000 MW or so of huge wind machines lining the coast.

See “Taming hurricanes with arrays of offshore wind turbines” in Nature Climate Change, February 26, 2014. https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2120

Clearly there is a real research question here. However, the results look to be both abstract and speculative at this point. But then, so is the rest of the climate change scare — abstract, speculative and based on questionable models.

It is both amusing and fitting that these alarming climate models find wind power to be just as scary as carbon dioxide. In wind’s case it might even be true because the generators really are sucking energy out of the air, and energy is what makes weather.

"Why ""Cheap"" Solar Increases the Price of Power",David Wojick,"I keep hearing that since solar power is cheap it pays to add it to the generation mix. Sometimes this claim is caveated, saying that it only pays up to a certain fraction of total generating capacity. Typical limits range from 30% to 60%. Moreover this claim that it pays to add solar is made by conservatives as well as liberals. We are, after all, just talking about money, not principles.

In reality this “solar pays” claim is like saying it pays to add a small, high mileage car as a second car. It ignores the added cost of buying two cars instead of one. With two car payments to make, you would only save money under very unusual conditions. For example, where you mostly drove the small car, drove a lot, and fuel was very expensive. None of these conditions hold when it comes to adding solar to the grid.

So let’s look into this cheap solar fallacy a bit more. Our starting point is the fabled cheapness. It is based on a simple measurement called the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). You just take the cost of producing electricity over a long period of time, divided by the amount produced. For grid scale generation LCOE is usually measured in dollars per megawatt hour (MWh).

It is true that most LCOE reports for America have solar (and onshore wind) a little bit lower than for combined cycle gas fired power, which is today’s workhorse generator. However the difference is relatively small. Solar LCOE also varies a lot regionally, depending on how sunny it is, but we can ignore that complexity for now.

The big point is that it is impossible for solar to generate reliably. Night always happens and clouds happen frequently. This means that for every MW of solar generation there has to be a MW of gas fired power (or something else) backing it up.

Since we do not need more electricity, solar + gas is a zero sum game, just like having two cars but only driving one. Whenever solar is powering, gas is sitting there costing money but making none, even though it could.

Simply put, the cost of not running the gas generator in order to run the solar is part of the cost of that solar power. This cost of forced idleness is sometimes called the “capacity cost” of the system. The capacity cost due to solar should part of the solar LCOE, but it is not.

The capacity cost of gas fired solar backup will be large. The cost of gas for a power plant is normally only about a third of the total cost of the plant. Gas fired plants are not as expensive to build as coal fired, because their boilers are somewhat smaller, but they are still very expensive.

So when solar power forces gas power to stop, you may save on fuel but the capacity cost of having that gas plant sit their idling is much larger.

Solar may be reducing gas fired emissions but it is certainly not paying off. The same is true for onshore wind. (Offshore wind has an LCOE that may be three times greater or more than onshore, so the savings issue does not even arise.) In fact both solar and onshore wind should only be seen as expensive emission reduction technologies, not as power generation technologies. Both cost extra.

The high cost of backup capacity is why states like California and countries like Germany, that have implemented lots of solar and wind, have such expensive electricity. The power production cost of solar and onshore wind my be low but the grid system cost is not low at all.

Adding low cost solar and wind power just makes grid electricity more expensive.

"Your Honor, CO2 is Not a Pollutant",,"Is carbon dioxide — two pounds of which each of us exhales daily — a pollutant? And are catastrophes increasing as a result of higher concentrations of the gas? Physics — along with a few other branches of science — says no.

Nonetheless, in a landmark 2007 Supreme Court ruling, the EPA concluded that it has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases, setting off a cascade of regulatory actions that target fossil fuels as emitters of a dangerous gas and promoting “green” energy as the solution. This ruling has become known as the “Endangerment Finding” and it determined that carbon dioxide was a “pollutant” that was dangerously warming the atmosphere and oceans, leading to climate catastrophe.

Now, the current Supreme Court is set to review the 15-year-old finding Feb. 28. Never mind that, according to Clean Air Act co-author John Dingell, Congress never intended for EPA to regulate greenhouse gases.

Setting aside legalistic arguments as to whether Congress or the EPA has the authority to make such decisions, the science is clear: Increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will not lead to the catastrophic consequences that the global warming enthusiasts predict. In fact, a recent Louisiana judge dictated that the EPA needs to use realistic metrics when evaluating the costs or benefits of more CO 2 . Using a higher, real-world discount rate mandated by Congress reveals that the “social cost of carbon” from increasing carbon dioxide emissions is a net benefit to society. That is correct. More CO 2 benefits society and the peoples of the Earth.

The Earth’s atmosphere has warmed about one degree Celsius since 1850, and CO 2 has increased approximately 130 parts-per-million since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to about 415 ppm today This combination of modest warming and a rise in atmospheric CO2 has provided a huge benefit to the Earth’s ecosystems and to humanity.

Contrary to predictions of ever-increasing catastrophes and harm to humanity, quite the opposite is occurring. By virtually every metric the planet’s ecosystems are improving and we are enjoying those benefits.

Deserts are shrinking, the bulk of the planet is enjoying re-forestation not de-forestation, vegetation is exploding across all ecological niches, natural disasters have been in a twenty-year decline, hurricanes are not increasing, the strongest tornadoes are in decline, and our air and water are cleaner today than in modern history. The majority of North American heat records were set 90 to 100 years ago. Where is the crisis? There is none.

That more carbon dioxide is fueling plant growth is accepted as fact by all parties in the climate debate (and yes, Virginia, there IS a debate). Modest warming is providing longer growing seasons in temperate climes, assisting in the cultivation and harvesting of more food. That increase in crop growth is turbocharged by the CO2 fertilization effect. With carbon dioxide increasing in recent decades, there have been significant improvements in crop harvests and an overall greening of Earth. Greenhouses add carbon dioxide to enhance production.

It is accepted by experts on both sides of the issue that carbon dioxide retains small amounts of solar radiation — heat — that otherwise would escape into outer space. Proponents of catastrophic man-made warming exaggerate this phenomenon, using unlikely and unsupportable high-end projections of the warming effect to achieve extreme heat scenarios of the future.

Whatever the cause of the temperature increases of the last 300 years, there is no need to fear carbon dioxide’s future greenhouse effect because the gas at the current concentration of approximately 400 parts per million has nearly reached its peak potency. Even if the gas were to double, the effect would be a mere one degree Celsius of warming— hardly an emergency.

A ruling by the Supreme Court to roll back the Endangerment Finding would simply be a ruling that “follows the science” and recognizes the important contributions that more CO 2 is having on the planet’s health and to the human condition.

"With New Energy Technologies, Beware of Spontaneous Combustion",H. Sterling Burnett,"It’s not uncommon for films and books in the horror, sci-fi, and mystery genres to feature characters spontaneously combusting. TV reality shows documenting strange mysteries sometimes feature instances where people have, to outward appearances, erupted into flames without any apparent cause.

Whether in fiction or the real world, instances of spontaneous combustion are usually traced to outside forces or poor personal choices. In fiction, the cause might be pyrokinesis, a curse, witchcraft, or, in mysteries, some elaborate device that causes the targeted character to catch fire. In the real world, the causes are much more mundane, such as faulty electric wiring in a blanket or nearby space heater or falling asleep with a burning cigarette in one’s hand.

A real-world example of spontaneous combustion, instances of which are becoming far more common, is devices with lithium-ion batteries erupting into flames without any apparent outside cause. This endangers lives and property, not just by the flames but also from the toxic fumes these fires emit.

Airlines were among the first to take notice of this problem. The risk was so great that they banned certain products containing lithium-ion batteries from planes. Airlines also restricted the class of battery devices that can be taken in carry-on luggage, to batteries with limited storage capacity. Even small backup batteries are banned from checked luggage.

A Google News search for the phrases “electric car house fire” or “house solar battery fire” turns up dozens of stories from the past couple of years detailing instances where battery systems connected to recently installed solar arrays or electric vehicle (EV) batteries being charged in garages spontaneously combusted, burning down all or part of peoples’ homes. Dozens more articles warn of the dangers to homes from such devices.

In August of 2021, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported approximately 12,000 residential energy solar panel systems’ battery modules had been recalled by their manufacturers in 2020 and to that point in 2021 because of the threat of combustion. This wasn’t because the electricians failed to do their jobs when wiring up the systems; the fires were caused by the systems themselves. The battery modules’ chemical makeup and construction make them prone to overheat and catch fire on occasion.

News stories and government reports detail numerous instances of EVs spontaneously burning. When an electric vehicle catches fire in or after an accident, that’s understandable. Cars with internal combustion engines can catch fire in these cases as well. It’s another thing entirely, however, when a car spontaneously catches fire when stuck in rush-hour traffic or when unattended, parked on the street or in one’s garage. Electric vehicles have been known to do this, especially while charging or caught in highway gridlock. In 2021, Chevrolet recalled all its electric Bolts to replace their battery modules because of the fire risk.

Then there are the large-scale fires associated with the battery modules intended for or installed in electric vehicles. In late July of 2021, a fire erupted at one of the largest battery factories in the world, a partnership with Tesla in Australia. The factory caught fire during testing and burned for days, with firefighters initially unable to fight the blaze because they lacked respirator equipment to protect them from the toxic fumes. Authorities told nearby residents to stay indoors and close windows and other air vents.

The Australian battery factory fire was by no means unique. CNBC has detailed more than 40 such spontaneous combustion incidents at battery factories or battery storage facilities in the past decade, most of which occurred in the past three years. A fire at a battery factory in Arizona in 2019 seriously injured two emergency responders, and two firefighters in China were killed when a battery module connected to rooftop solar panels at a shopping mall burst into flames.

It is relatively rare for large, modern ships to catch fire and burn for an extended period, much less having to be abandoned and sinking because of fire. They are made of steel and have modern fire-suppression equipment installed or available. Perhaps this equipment is no longer modern enough. In mid-February, a cargo ship carrying battery-powered Porches, Bentleys, and Volkswagens totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in value erupted into flames. Whether the battery modules caused the fire is unknown. What is known, however, is that battery packs at least fueled the fire, making it grow quickly and emit toxic fumes. The crew could not put out the fire before the fumes forced them to abandon the ship. It burned for days and sank before a salvage crew could get it safely to port.

In a previous issue of Climate Change Weekly, I detailed some of the environmental drawbacks of the push for a big EV expansion in the United States. And in a recent post on Liberty and Ecology, I detailed some of the practical hurdles that make it unlikely EVs will suit most drivers’ needs in the near future. But inconvenience is one thing; the fact that the battery modules powering EVs and backing up rooftop solar systems are prone to spontaneous combustion and thus potentially deadly is another thing entirely.

This much is clear: before you add a solar system with backup battery to your home, check with your homeowner’s insurance to find out what you have to do to keep from voiding your coverage in the case of a battery-caused fire. Do the same when purchasing an electric vehicle you intend to charge in your garage. These systems require special wiring, and you should make sure to get the electrical work certified by your local government agency in charge of such things. Otherwise, if a battery fire burns your house down, you may find yourself in for a second shock when your insurer tells you the incident was not covered.

AP TO PASS OFF PAID PRESS RELEASES BY CLIMATE ALARMISTS AS NEWS … U.S. CORN ETHANOL WORSE FOR THE CLIMATE THAN GASOLINE … TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENTS ARE INCONSISTENT AND DON’T MATCH REALITY, SCIENTISTS FIND

AP TO PASS OFF PAID PRESS RELEASES BY CLIMATE ALARMISTS AS NEWS

In mid-February, the Associated Press (AP) made official what I have long maintained is standard practice: passing off press releases and blog posts from climate change activists and groups and those who fund them, as if they were actual news stories.

According to an AP press release, the agency is accepting an $8 million grant from five prominent foundations known for promoting and backing organizations that promote climate alarm. The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Quadrivium, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Walton Family Foundation are funding the hiring of more than two dozen journalists to report on climate issues primarily from Africa, Brazil, India, and the United States.

AP says this program is its “largest single expansion paid for through philanthropic grants, … illustrat[ing] how philanthropy has swiftly become an important new funding source for journalism.”

“This far-reaching initiative will transform how we cover the climate story,” said AP senior vice president and executive editor Julie Pace in the press release announcing the grant program. I’ll bet!

Commenting on AP’s decision to take millions from climate-woke foundations to fund climate reporting, Climate Depot’s Mark Morano said,

The media’s coverage of climate change has sunk to a new journalistic low. … The mainstream media, led by the Associated Press, is now publicly admitting they are just phoning in their coverage on “climate change.” Led by the Rockefeller Foundation and others, the AP will be parroting what the ideological activist groups’ funding pays for, while actual news will be tossed aside. Journalistic standards are now officially out the window. There will be no attempt to present a patina of objectivity, balance or unbiased news by the AP when it comes to “climate change.”

With this announcement, AP has very publicly ceased to be a legitimate news gathering and reporting organization, at least in reporting on climate change. It has become a bought and paid-for shill for the environmental movement, spreading climate alarm around the world.

Upton Sinclair reportedly once said, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” Similarly, William Jennings Bryant reportedly said, “It is useless to argue with a man whose opinion is based upon a personal or pecuniary interest.”

Can anyone honestly believe AP will report objectively on climate matters when climate change alarm foundations are giving it millions of dollars? This is especially egregious when evidence indicates a climate crisis is not in the offing and bad weather events are not extreme in the context of history and recent data. To do so would be to bite the climate-woke hand feeding them. Reader, beware.

U.S. CORN ETHANOL WORSE FOR THE CLIMATE THAN GASOLINE

A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds adding ethanol to or substituting corn-based ethanol for gasoline causes more greenhouse gas emissions than using gasoline without ethanol.

The study found the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which specifies the amount of biofuels that must be be added to transportation fuel in the United States, resulted in 24 percent higher greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector than would have occurred without the mandated substitution of ethanol for gasoline required by the federal government in the 2005 Energy Policy Act as expanded under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.

The study also reported a variety of other negative effects of the government’s ethanol mandate. For instance, the ethanol mandate caused corn prices by to rise by 30 percent and the prices of other crops by 20 percent. Higher prices resulted in corn cultivation increasing by 8.7 percent in the years after enactment of the mandate. The study also reported the rapid expansion of corn grown for ethanol resulted in an annual growth of fertilizer use nationwide of 3 percent to 8 percent. The RFS also measurably decreased water quality, wildlife habitat, and the storage of carbon dioxide in the soil.

The study by researchers in a variety of scientific disciplines—agroecologists, environmental modelers, and economists from University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of California-Davis, Kansas State University, and the University of Kentucky—was funded in part by the National Wildlife Federation and U.S. Department of Energy.

“It basically reaffirms what many suspected, that corn ethanol is not a climate-friendly fuel and we need to accelerate the shift toward better renewable fuels, as well as make improvements in efficiency and electrification,” Tyler Lark, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a scientist in the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center and the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Technology Networks.

TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENTS ARE INCONSISTENT AND DON’T MATCH REALITY, SCIENTISTS FIND

New research published in the scientific journal Atmosphere states the methods routinely used to adjust raw data recorded for European temperature records are flawed and introduce systemic bias in the reported adjusted temperatures.

In the paper, titled “Evaluation of the Homogenization Adjustments Applied to European Temperature Records in the Global Historical Climatology Network Dataset,” 17 researchers from 13 countries examined data adjustments applied to the European temperature records in the dataset over the last 10 years.

The Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) monthly temperature dataset is the main source of thermometer records used by official government agencies charged with monitoring, tracking, and reporting temperature and weather data, such as NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).

Over time, temperature records from individual weather stations often show abrupt changes due to local factors that have nothing to do with global or national temperature trends. These include changes in the location of the weather station, changes in types of thermometers used, and the growth of urban heat islands near or around stations.

In a process called homogenization, NOAA, which maintains the GHCN dataset, uses computer programs to correct for these non-climatic changes by identifying abrupt jumps in the records through statistical methods and applying formulae to adjust the data.

Examining the homogenization adjustments for more than 800 European temperature records in thousands of datasets, the researchers found the adjustments often changed dramatically within a single day and from day to day when NOAA reran its computer program. The analysis showed just 17 percent of NOAA’s adjustments were consistent from one run to the next. In addition, the researchers found less than 20 percent of the adjustments made by the computer simulations corresponded to an unusual jump in the data trend that matched a change in the system or location, such as a new artificial heat source being erected nearby or a shift in location.

In addition, the adjustments were repeatedly applied to past records, as a new day’s temperature was added to the set, meaning, for example, data recorded at a site in 1951 could change from day to day as new temperatures were recorded.

Unless errors were found in how the previous adjustment was calculated, homogenized temperatures from the past should not be changing from day to day. This indicates a systematic problem with the homogenization program.

“[T]he authors warned that these bizarre inconsistencies in this widely-used climate dataset are scientifically troubling,” the Center for Environmental Research and Earth Sciences reports. “They also are concerned that most researchers using this important dataset have been unaware of these problems until now.”

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: “Garbage in, garbage out.” In this case, however, the garbage looks like it’s being generated by the homogenization process itself and churned, much like the mulch it resembles, on a daily basis.

Biden Continues to Flip-Flop on Crude Oil Policies,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","A year before being inaugurated President in 2021, Biden professed that “we are going to get rid of fossil fuels. Before the recent inauguration, America achieved for the first time since Harry Truman was president about 70 years ago, to finally become crude oil independent and no longer held hostage to unstable Petro-powers and the vagaries of foreign crude oil supplies.

Biden continues flip-flopping his crude oil strategies for America:

The domino effect of tinkering with the supply chain of fossil fuels is supply shortages and soaring prices for not only electricity, but for the thousands of products that support the entire medical industry, all branches of the military, airports, electronics, communications, merchant ships, container ships, and cruise liners, as well as asphalt for roads, and fertilizers to help feed the world.

The decarbonization efforts of the Green New Deal (GND) are well under way attempting to utilize breezes and sunshine to replace 2 of the fossil fuels – coal and natural gas – that have been used for generating continuous uninterruptible electricity.

Crude oil is seldom ever used for electricity generation, but somewhere along the line, crude oil got caught on the chopping block efforts to eliminate ALL 3 fossil fuels. Today, allowing banks and investment giants to collude to reshape economies and energy infrastructure with their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels is a very dangerous precedent.

The renewable energy scam is that breezes and sunshine can only generate electricity. Electricity realism requires that the legislators, policymakers, and the media that demonstrate pervasive ignorance about crude oil usage, understand the staggering scale of the decarbonization challenge.

There needs to be a back-up plan to the hydrocarbon processing industry, i.e., refineries, which has a rich history of discovery, challenges, breakthroughs, trial and error, collaboration, and success. Looking back a little more than 100 years, it’s easy to see how civilization has benefited from more than 250 leading-edge, hydrocarbon processing licensed refining technologies used by the more than 700 refineries worldwide that service the demands of the 8 billion living on earth with more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products were available to society before 1900.

Any leader that can oscillate his crude oil policies so quickly and radically, needs to comprehend some energy literacy to understand American’s demands for virtually all the products that support their lifestyles and economies resulted in fossil fuels production expected to reach record highs in 2023. Citizens are not about to be mandated to live like our ancestors.

The result is that Biden has made things worse and continues to increase inflation and world pollution. He is achieving the exact opposite of what he preaches. It seems that he is using the curtailment of petroleum production as a tool to help decrease population via increased deaths from lack of petroleum products that are the basis of lifestyles and economies around the world.

The link between energy and foreign policy is that energy extends beyond JUST electricity and includes the direct use of natural gas and the more than 6,000 petroleum products that were not available before 1900 required to support civilization as we know it, and to manufacture vehicles and aircraft.

China and Russia are great War historians of WWI and WWII, and know that the countries that controls the minerals, crude oil, and natural gas, controls the world! Biden has done a great job of relinquishing “CONTROL” for the “green” materials to China, and relinquishing “CONTROL” of the crude oil to OPEC and Russia! God help America!

An abundance of energy leads to prosperity, while a restriction or lack of energy leads to economic struggle and poverty.

We can look forward to more oscillating energy signals from Biden, as he has no backup plan for a replacement for the products manufactured from oil, the efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change. Attaining a decarbonized world like the one that existed in the 1800’s and before, would result in billions of fatalities for the 8 billion on earth from disease, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Favors More Energy Costs for All,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","America, with 4.1 percent of the world’s population (330 million vs 8 billion) professes to be the leader of everything but tightening the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for particulate matter is ludicrous when China, India, Indonesia, Japan, and Vietnam are sending their existing PM2.5 across the Pacific Ocean to America, particularly California, and building new coal power plants that will emit even more PM2.5.

China (1.4 billion), India (1.36 billion), Indonesia (270 million), Japan (126 million) and Vietnam (80 million) plan to build more than 600 coal power units, and African countries (1.2 billion) are planning to build more than 1,250 new coal and gas-fired power plants by 2030.

The healthier and wealthier countries fail to recognize that at least 80 percent of humanity, or more than 6 billion in this world are living on less than $10 a day, and billions living with little to no access to electricity, These poor folks need abundant, affordable, reliable, scalable, and flexible electricity while The healthier and wealthier are pursuing the most expensive ways to generate intermittent electricity from breezes and sunshine.

While developing countries are ramping up their arsenals of air polluting coal fired power plants, California continues to shutter natural gas and nuclear power generating plants that have provided continuous uninterruptable electricity. Through California’s dysfunctional energy policies the state imports more electricity than any other state– currently at 32 percent from the Northwest and Southwest and dysfunctional HOPES that other states will be able to generate enough power to meet the demands of the state.

With no known replacement for crude oil in the foreseeable future, civilization has benefited from more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products were available to society before 1900. Today, billions of people each year travel to various destinations around the world via more than 50,000 commercial, private, and military jets.

Virtually all the components of wind turbines, solar panels, and all forms of transportation are assembled with products made from oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. Ridding the world of crude oil would eliminate most forms of transportation and electricity generation from wind and solar.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), with no backup plan to make the products that are the basis of the medical industry, electronics, communications, etc., proposes to continue their anti-crude oil agenda to tinker with the supply chain of crude oil via restrictions on exploration, fracking, and oil well setbacks, to focus on electricity generation from breezes and sunshine. Those efforts to rid society of crude oil is an oxymoron, as crude oil is seldom ever used for the generation of electricity.

ivilization has benefited from more than 250 leading-edge, hydrocarbon processing licensed refining technologies used by the more than 700 refineries worldwide that service the demands of the 8 billion living on earth with more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products were available to society before 1900.

California refineries are among the cleanest, most environmentally friendly in the world and some of the most responsible employers. The U.S. EPA actions to further reduce particulate emissions to clean up the cleanest refineries in the world, will shift control of the West Coast’s aviation fuel demand for the West Coast military, the International Airports at Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Santa Ana, airports, as well as the cruise ships, Coast Guard, and merchant ships servicing West Coast ports. Aviation fuel dependency will start shifting over to China as the primary supplier of aviation fuels to the West Coast.

The U.S. EPA may not be cognizant that oil and gas are an international industry with 700 refineries worldwide as they remain supportive of huge emissions from polluting foreign oil tankers and creating a national security risk for all of America, as California’s dependency on foreign suppliers for California’s crude oil needs, as well as the West Coast military operations, continues to grow.

With no backup plan for a replacement for the products manufactured from oil, the efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change, resulting in billions of fatalities of the 8 billion on earth from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths.

The proposed tightening of the PM2.5 NAAQS will barely reduce particulate emission reductions while raising the nation’s highest energy prices in California even more for the 18 million (45 percent of the 40 million Californians) that represent the Hispanic and African American populations of the state, and the more than two million undocumented immigrants.

The U.S. EPA appears to be disconnected from most Americans, as they must be oblivious to the January 11, 2022 Environmental Information Agency (EIA) report that U.S. Fossil Fuels Production to Reach Record Highs in 2023. The U.S. EPA may be sabotaging the American economy with shortages and inflation in the name of unattainable climate targets and may go down in history as causing the continent to be homage to China for the materials to go green, and to Russia and OPEC for crude oil.

The U.S. EPA has failed to understand that the most important fact about today’s environmental movement, and what the Pulitzer Prize nominated new book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy” explores, is that the healthy and wealthy countries of the United States of America, Germany, the UK, and Australia continue to exploit the most vulnerable people and environments of the world today. These wealthy countries representing 6 percent of the world’s population (505 million vs 7.8 billion) could literally shut down, and cease to exist, and the opposite of what you have been told and believe will take place.

Simply put, in these healthy and wealthy countries, every person, animal, or anything that causes emissions to harmfully rise could vanish off the face of the earth; or even die off, and global emissions will still explode in the coming years and decades ahead over the population and economic growth of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam, and Africa.

The U.S. EPA has shown empathy toward those potential few fatalities from local particulate matter, but has shown no concern toward currently, underdeveloped countries, mostly from energy starved countries with yellow, brown, and black colored skin residents, that are experiencing about 11,000,000 child deaths every year of which more than 70 per cent are attributable to six causes: diarrhea, malaria, neonatal infection, pneumonia, preterm delivery, or lack of oxygen at birth. About 29,000 children under the age of five – 21 each minute – die every day, mainly from preventable causes.

The U.S. EPA feels good about tightening the PM2.5 NAAQS for Americans but maintains their “blinders” toward millions of other worldwide fatalities. America continues to “leak” emissions and air quality responsibilities to developing countries halfway around the world, the same countries that have virtually non-existent environmental regulations nor labor controls to protect the local workers in those developing countries. I hope the U.S. EPA scientists can sleep peacefully!

A Little History of the Hydrocarbon Processing that Meets Society’s Demands,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The hydrocarbon processing industry, i.e., refineries, has a rich history of discovery, challenges, breakthroughs, trial and error, collaboration, and success. Looking back a little more than 100 years, it’s easy to see how civilization has benefited from more than 250 leading-edge, hydrocarbon processing licensed refining technologies used by the more than 700 refineries worldwide that service the demands of the 8 billion living on earth with more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products were available to society before 1900.

If it were not for the demands of society, it’s easy to understand that there would be no need whatsoever for the supply of crude oil to refineries, to be manufactured into usable products if there was no demand for those products. As the public remains unwilling to be mandated and regulated into an inferior lifestyle like our predecessors just a few hundred years ago, we have been witnessing shortages and inflation of most everything these days.

With the world enthralled with the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) movement to divest in fossil fuels and plastic i.e., bottles, plates, and utensils and with no known replacement in the foreseeable future for the crude oil used in the hydrocarbon processing industry, i.e., refineries, let’s review some of the inventions that may be excluded from our lifestyles in the future. We’ll do a review, in layman’s terms, on the origins of the modern refining and petrochemicals industries that supports todays demands for polyethylene, synthetic fibers, resins, and jet engines:

NOTE: If you have no interest in the 16 points about the development of the hydrocarbon processing industry, please jump to the concluding comments.

The hydrocarbon processing industry continued to evolve during the 1930s. Starting with the discovery of kerosene, the construction of new refineries around the world, the production of the first synthetic plastics, and the rise of the internal combustion engine (ICE), oil demand’s exponential growth during and after World War I (WWI) and how thermal cracking evolved in refining processing.

Around the timeframe (circa 1938), the alkylation process was commercialized in the U.S. The process produced high-octane aviation fuel, which saw significant demand increase during World War 2 (WW2). The process was then used in the 1950s to produce blending components for automotive fuel.

In 1939, the first commercial-scale polyethylene plant went into operation on an industrial scale. Within the next few years, many polyethylene plants went into operation, primarily to aide in the allied war effort. polyethylene was used extensively as insulating material for radar cables during WW2. The material was lightweight, which enabled Britain to install radar in their fighter planes, providing a significant technical advantage in long-distance air warfare. Due to this wartime advantage, the production of polyethylene for insulated cabling was highly secretive. It was not until post WW2 that the production of polyethylene was commercialized. Within several years, PE production capacity significantly increased and would later become the world’s most used thermoplastic.

Several new chemical discoveries took place in the 1930s that have provided the global population with new products to improve standards of living. These included the discovery and production of polystyrene, polyepoxide, nylon, polyester, and neoprene.

Although polystyrene was discovered in the late 1830s, styrene—which would lead to the production of polystyrene—would not be commercialized for nearly 100 years. Styrene production increased significantly in both Germany and in the U.S. during WW2 to produce synthetic rubbers to aide in the war effort. In the late 1930s, Dow Chemical created foam polystyrene which expanded approximately 40 times in size. Dow would later commercialize this discovery as expanded polystyrene, better known and marketed under the name Styrofoam .

After the discovery of neoprene in 1931 for many applications (construction, automotive, medical equipment, fabrics, electrical equipment, textiles, among others) efforts were directed to producing synthetic fibers. By the mid-1930s, Nylon first became a household product as women’s hosiery, later being used in the U.S. war effort to produce parachutes and tents. Over the next several decades, nylon would be used extensively as a combined fabric in fashion and apparel, as well as in several industrial applications—the global nylon industry market size is forecast to reach more than $46 billion by the late 2020s.

Research also led to the discovery of polyester in the early 1930s. However, the discovery of nylon pushed additional research on polyester to the backburner. It was not until the late 1930s that work on synthetic fibers would eventually lead to the development of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in 1941. In the early 1970s, PET began to be used in the production of plastic bottles, and today, PET is the fourth most produced polymer after PE, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride.

The DuPont company was not finished with major polymer discoveries of the 1930s. Researching chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants to find a better way to refrigerate food. Further investigation found the substance to be heat resistant and had a low surface friction. DuPont polymer scientists determined that the tetrafluoroethylene gas polymerized to produce the material, which DuPont would later market under the name Teflon.

In 1936, Monsanto Chemical Co., produced melamine formaldehyde by polymerizing formaldehyde with melamine. This new substance was a thermosetting plastic that was very good at maintaining strength and shape. Melamine resins were used for many different applications, including in utensils, plates, furniture, cups, bowls, laminates, toilet seats, automotive and epoxy coatings, among others. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is a clear thermoplastic resin that is more transparent than glass and 6x–7x more resistant to breakage than glass. PMMA is also known as acrylic, acrylic glass, perspex, or plexiglass, as well as by the trade names and brands Crylux, Plexiglas , Acrylite, Astariglas, Lucite , Perclax, and Perspex, among several others. This plastic is often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to glass. It can also be used as a casting resin, in inks and coatings, and for many other purposes.

Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is commonly used for prosthetic dental applications, including the fabrication of artificial teeth, denture bases, dentures, obturators, orthodontic retainers, temporary or provisional crowns, and for the repair of dental prostheses.

Around the same timeframe, creation of the epoxy resin bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (DGEBA or commonly abbreviated as BADGE), which would become the most widely used commercial-grade resin in the world. Epoxy resins are presently used in many industrial and commercial applications, including paints and coatings, adhesives, electrical systems and electronics, marine and aerospace applications, and many more.

In 1937, Bayer created a new polymer named polyurethane , which would later be used in many applications, including in construction, furniture, insulation, coatings, adhesives, sealants, elastomers, moldings, appliances, automotive, apparel and many more.

A look at the ingenuity that took us to the skies. Prior to designing engines, British engineer and inventor Frank Whittle was an airplane apprentice and pilot at the Royal Air Force (RAF) College Cranwell. Whittle believed that the evolution in flight would not be better propeller designs but the use of improved combustion engines for propulsion. In addition, he believed that airplanes would be able to fly faster (more than 500 mph) and farther at higher altitudes due to low air density. Whittle continued to publicize his jet engine concept and filed a patent for his engine design two years later in 1930. According to literature, the concept was a two-stage axial compressor feeding a single-sided centrifugal compressor, what he referred to as a “turbojet.”

Unbeknownst to Whittle, German physicist and engineer Hans von Ohain was developing a similar jet engine in Germany. on August 27, 1939, test pilot Erich Warsitz flew a plane equipped with a HeS 3b centrifugal-flow turbojet engine—the latest iteration. This historic day marked the world’s first jet-powered aircraft flight.

Although Ohain beat Whittle to the first jet engine test flight, Whittle continued to improve his designs. As WW2 started, he received additional financial backing from the UK Air Ministry. In 1940, the first British jet-powered plane—the Gloster E.28/39—was flown using Whittle’s W1A engine. As war raged in Europe, the UK Air Ministry was ordering several thousand jet engines per month. By 1944, Whittle’s engine design—produced by Rolls Royce—was used in the first British fighter planes, the Gloster Meteor, that could reach speeds of 600 mph.

Over the next several years, jet engine designs continued to be optimized, primarily for military aircraft. However, on July 27, 1949, the world’s first jet-propelled airliner made its test flight in England. This historic occasion marked the first use of a jet-powered passenger plane, which would revolutionize travel. Over the next several decades, the jet-powered passenger plane would enable passengers to travel faster and farther in a shorter duration and build a nearly $200 billion industry to carry billions of people each year to various destinations around the world via more than 50,000 commercial, military, and private jets.

As the world engaged in conflict in the 1940’s, demand for fuels and chemical products manufactured from crude oil soared to aid in the war effort. Post-WW2 ushered in new technological advances for producing higher octane fuels and chemical products that increased the standard of living for hundreds of millions around the world.

Today, there are more than 250 leading-edge, hydrocarbon processing licensed refining technologies used by the more than 700 refineries worldwide that service the demands of the 8 billion living on earth with more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products were available to society before 1900.

We know that wind turbines and solar panels are made from the derivatives manufactured from crude oil. Turbines and panels are made from oil, and obviously cannot manufacture anything, they can only generate electricity whenever the wind blows or the sun shines.

With more than 100 years of development in the hydrocarbon processing industry, we still have yet to identify a replacement or clone to replicate the properties of crude oil that has allowed us to manufacture more than 6,000 products made from fossil fuels that were not available before 1900.

As the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting objectives to divest in fossil fuels progresses throughout the world, most of the hydrocarbon processing industry discoveries over the last 100 years will most likely experience supply shortages and soaring prices as the continuous and growing demand by society for these fossil fuel products will fuel (no pun intended) inflation onto the diminished supplies of those products.

The Similarities Between ESG And Fascism Are Scary,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","As Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels progresses, by many of the masters of the financial universe, the short memories of petrochemicals’ golden goose contributions to societies are leading the world to an era of Extreme Shortages Guaranteed (ESG) like we had in the decarbonized world in the 1800’s!

Allowing banks and investment giants like BlackRock, led by CEO Larry Fink to collude to reshape economies and energy infrastructure is a very dangerous precedent. Their movement that promotes the idea of a forcibly monolithic, regimented nation under the control of the investment community is scarily beginning to resemble the fascism that dominated the media in the past. The American people never voted to give banks this sort of control over our country.

The notion is incomprehensible that unelected and unaccountable functionaries—such as Larry Fink of Blackrock, World Economic Forum executive chairman Klaus Schwab, Federal Reserve Bank Governor Lael Brainard, or SEC Chairman Gary Gensler—can legitimately substitute their progressive beliefs and fixations for the will of the American people that businesses should provide compliance to their ESG guidelines (regardless of the costs), and that the general population should stand aside and accept whatever its betters say is necessary.

Depriving citizens of the more than 6,000 products that were non-existent before 1900, made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, is immoral and evil as extreme shortages will result in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths.

Virtually all the components of wind turbines, solar panels, and all forms of transportation are assembled with products made from oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. Ridding the world of crude oil would eliminate most forms of transportation and electricity generation from wind and solar.

The domino effects of tinkering with the supply chain of crude oil, is supply shortages and soaring prices for not only electricity, but for the thousands of products that support the entire medical industry, all branches of the military, airports, electronics, communications, merchant ships, container ships, and cruise liners, as well as asphalt for roads, and fertilizers to help feed the world.

Why is this type of ESG environmental crusade so destructive? Why has it gone from great intentions to utter destruction? They are now the worst form of environmental nihilism morphed into ideological fervor the world has not witnessed since the rise of National Socialism in Germany in the early 1930s. Adolf Hitler appeared on the cover of Time Magazine on multiple occasions, and most famously, on January 2, 1939, when Time Magazine named Adolph Hitler their Man of the Year. The mainstream media endorsed National Socialism, and it is now promoting globally destructive green transition on all seven continents.

Many African, Asian, and South American children with black, brown, and yellow skin are being enslaved and dying in mines and factories to extract and process rare earth and exotic minerals required to support the green movement of the wealthier and healthier countries for solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and utility-scale storage systems to work. The authors of the Pulitzer Prize nominated book, “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy,” call these, BLOOD MINERALS.

If fascism is invisible to us, it is truly the silent killer. It fastens a huge, violent, lumbering state on the free market that drains its capital and productivity like a deadly parasite on a host. The author of the 1939 book “Vampire Economy”, Gunter Reimann, discusses how the fascist state sucks the economic life out of a nation and brings about a slow death of a once-thriving economy.

But most people hear this and dismiss it, probably for good reason. The poor in this country are not poor by any historical standard. They have cell phones, cable TV, cars, lots of food, and plenty of disposable income. What’s more, there is no such thing as a fixed class called the poor. People come and go, depending on age and life circumstances. Plus, in American politics, when you hear kvetching about the poor, everyone knows what you’re supposed to do: hand the government your wallet.

No longer can one generation expect to live a better life than the previous one. The fascist economic model has killed what was once called the American dream. And the truth is, of course, even worse than the statistic reveals. You must consider how many incomes exist within a single household to make up the total income. After World War II, the single-income family became the norm. Then the money was destroyed, and American savings were wiped out and the capital base of the economy was devastated.

It was at this point that households began to struggle to stay above water. The year 1985 was the turning point. This was the year that it became more common than not for a household to have two incomes rather than one. Mothers entered the workforce to keep family income floating.

Today median family income is only slightly above where it was when Nixon wrecked the dollar, put on price and wage controls, created the EPA, and the whole apparatus of the parasitic welfare-warfare state came to be entrenched and made universal.

The problem is more fundamental. It is the quality of the money. It is the very existence of 10,000 regulatory agencies. It is the whole assumption that you must pay the state for the privilege to work. It is the presumption that the government must manage every aspect of the capitalist economic order. In short, it is the total state that is the problem, and the suffering and decline will continue so long as the total state exists.

No aspect of life is untouched by government intervention, and often it takes forms we do not readily see. All of healthcare is regulated, but so is every bit of our food, transportation, clothing, household products, and even private relationships.

Let’s just mention the reality: No government in the history of the world has spent as much, borrowed as much, and created as much fake money as the United States. If the United States doesn’t qualify as a fascist state in this sense, no government ever has.

Fascism has no new ideas, no big projects—and not even its partisans really believe it can accomplish what it sets out to do. The world created by the private sector is so much more useful and beautiful than anything the state has done that the fascists have themselves become demoralized and aware that their agenda has no real intellectual foundation.

The similarities between the effects of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting objectives and fascism are scary as efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change. Attaining a decarbonized world like the one that existed in the 1800’s, would result in billions of fatalities from disease, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths.

Farming the Air,David Wojick,"You are built almost entirely out of carbon dioxide and water. So is all the food you eat. Likewise for all the energy you use moving about and staying alive. Carbon dioxide and water! In short the carbon dioxide in the air is the global food supply. This is why all life on Earth is said to be “carbon based”.

The climate alarmists play a tricky word game here. They call carbon dioxide “pollution” and wind and solar power “clean.” Our food supply is not pollution. Nor is emitting carbon dioxide (which we all do when we exhale) unclean. This is just false advertising. Watching a child grow is watching processed carbon dioxide be reprocessed.

Here is how it works. Plants collect carbon dioxide from the air then use sunlight and water to create the stuff they consume to build their bodies and to live on. They also use tiny amounts of vitamins and minerals, just as we do. Fertilizer is like vitamins, not like food. So almost all of what they use is carbon dioxide and water. Animals eat the plants for food, basically reprocessing the carbon dioxide and water. Then we eat both plants and animals.

There is a saying that you cannot live on air but in fact that is just what we do. All of our food begins as airborne (or waterborne) carbon dioxide. Our farmers are literally farming the air!

Go into a grocery store and look around. All the food you see — vegetables, fruit and meat — fresh, frozen or canned — is processed carbon dioxide. So are the people shopping there. So are you.

The climate scare is based on the fact that the amount of carbon dioxide in the air has been slowly increasing for the last hundred years or so. That this might cause a tiny bit of global warming is really not a problem. The good news is that plant productivity is increasing around the world as a direct result of the increasing carbon dioxide. This is called the “greening” of planet Earth and it has been clearly observed by NASA satellites.

So the global food supply of carbon dioxide has been steadily increasing. This helps explain how we are able to feed our growing human population. Crop yields have consistently increased even though the amount of farm land has actually gone down.

The actual process is a miracle. Plants are passive consumers. They sit there and wait for carbon dioxide molecules to bump into them, where they are then combined with water and sunlight to make the plant’s food. Carbon dioxide is called a trace gas because there is very little of it as a fraction of the air. A hundred years ago it is estimated that there was something like one carbon dioxide molecule out of every 3,000 air molecules. Today it is more like one out of 2,500 which is a big help to the passive plants.

Note that this increase in global plant growth due to increasing carbon dioxide is incorrectly called the “fertilization effect”. It should be called the food effect. Imagine putting on a table everything you will eat in a day. Next to that put a vitamin pill. Fertilizer is like the pill while carbon dioxide is like the pile of food.

Also the carbon dioxide is not there because of our burning gasoline, diesel, natural gas, oil and coal. It is part of a natural “carbon cycle” that is twenty times bigger than our emissions. Life on Earth is part of and depends on this natural carbon cycle. Our carbon dioxide just adds a little bit to it, which is a good thing.

Unfortunately you will seldom, if ever, hear any of this, because of climate change hysteria. Carbon dioxide is called dangerous pollution, when it is actually the stuff of life. The increase is decried as bad when it is actually good. The alarmists want to stop the increase or even reverse it, ignoring that this is the global food supply. As a carbon based life form we should be leery of calls for “decarbonization”.

Likewise calling wind and solar power “clean energy” just because they do not create carbon dioxide is false, bordering on a hoax. There is nothing unclean about carbon dioxide. It is our food.

We should be very thankful that carbon dioxide is increasing, not demonizing it. We are all made of carbon dioxide.

Which Side Will Colorado Be On?,Greg E. Walcher,"Sometimes as part of a dire prediction, someone will say, “I hope I’m wrong, but…”

When I heard about a new petition for the U.S. Supreme Court to hear another appeal on the extent of federal jurisdiction over water – the perennial “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) issue, I did not think the nation’s highest court would agree to hear the case. That’s partly because the justices agree to hear less than one percent of the cases brought to them, and also because EPA argued that the case is not “ripe,” because the agency will soon finalize another new WOTUS rule. That argument is usually persuasive to a court that is habitually reluctant to rule on anything it doesn’t yet have to. But to almost everyone’s surprise, last week the Court granted the petition, agreeing to hear the case – Sackett v. EPA – and reconsider the issue. The court denied 129 petitions, and granted only four, including this one. That raises the possibility that the question could finally be settled.

The confusion and inconsistency resulting from two opposite federal court rulings on WOTUS is among the greatest threats to Colorado water during my lifetime. The dispute represents a grave danger to the historic doctrine – reinforced many times over the past century – that water belongs to, and is controlled by, the states. The exception to that fundamental principle is the Clean Water Act, which created federal authority to regulate “navigable waters of the U.S.,” meaning major rivers, bays, inter-coastal waterways, and oceans, which involve interstate commerce. The law remained clear that inland waters belong to the states, and Congress has never attempted to change that. But presidents and regulators have tried to do so, leading to the court case that began this roller-coaster of confusion and contradiction.

That now-famous 2006 case, Rapanos v. United States, produced two competing definitions of “waters of the U.S.” in a strangely muddled 4-1-4 decision – two different views of where federal jurisdiction begins and ends. Four Justices shared the plurality opinion, written by Antonin Scalia, that the law covers wetlands only if they have a continuous surface connection to a river, lake or other major waterway. A fifth, Anthony Kennedy, agreed with the ruling, but with different reasoning, and wrote his own opinion – joined by no other Justice – saying the Clean Water Act covers all wetlands with a “significant nexus” to the larger bodies of water. What is “significant nexus?” Who knows – there is no such term in the Clean Water Act.

Nevertheless, the Obama EPA relied on the lone opinion of Justice Kennedy, in creating one of the most egregious power grabs in environmental history, asserting federal jurisdiction over every stream, rill, brook, creek, rivulet, backwater, stock pond, and parking lot drain in the country. It started a legal war with many states, though none had more to lose than Colorado, in terms of water.

Colorado helped lead the legal challenge, joined by half the other states, with full support of the Democratic legislature and then-Governor Hickenlooper. A federal Court of Appeals agreed, ruling that EPA had exceeded its statutory authority and blocking it in all 26 states. A different federal court disagreed, so the rule was blocked in 26 states and implemented in 24. Then the Trump Administration repealed the rule, issuing a new one based on the original plurality Supreme Court opinion, as Colorado had demanded. It was a hard-fought and enormously important victory for the State. But then, something unheard-of in the West happened.

Confounding generations of Colorado leaders, who always viewed protecting Colorado’s water as a non-partisan duty, newly-elected State Attorney General Phil Weiser filed an exactly-opposite suit seeking reinstatement of the Obama-era interpretation – federal control over Colorado water (he lost in court). That bizarre action defied the 2016 “Colorado Water Rights Protection Act,” passed unanimously by the Democratic legislature and signed by Hickenlooper, strongly opposing federal control. The Act re-asserted the constitutional principle that waters of Colorado belong to the people of Colorado, and are administered under State law.

There are no navigable waters in Colorado involving interstate commerce. EPA’s claim of jurisdiction, despite that obvious fact, may not be new (landowners have dealt with it off-and-on for decades), but it is nevertheless contrary to law. The Supreme Court finally has a chance to make that clear.

Predictably, many organizations will file briefs and opinions in this case, including states. Which side will Colorado be on this time? Will its officials defend its water, or knuckle under to federal control?

Pension Plans and Private Investments Are Not Woke Playthings,"H. Sterling Burnett, Bette Grande","Many major banks, corporations, investment management firms, and pension funds are adopting leftist environment, social, and governance (ESG) programs and investment and business strategies. In addition, they are telling their peers in the business and pension community to do so, and just in case others don’t follow their lead, they are advocating state and federal governments force all companies to take up a variety of liberal, woke causes. Foremost among these is fighting climate change by ending fossil fuel use.

It is an open question whether they are doing this as a matter of virtue signaling, because their managers or owners really believe a climate apocalypse is on the way, or in anticipation of government regulations that could harm or benefit their businesses.

What is almost certainly not true is that they see this as a good investment opportunity absent government enforcement on everyone. If it were, investment houses such as BlackRock and banks like Bank of America wouldn’t be calling for federal regulation. Instead, they would use ESG investment as a moneymaking opportunity they could cash in on at the expense of their competition.

It is more likely the leaders of these companies are woefully woke or cynical crony capitalists who fear going down the green path unless government forces others to adopt ESG investment standards. If government does not impose their strategies, these companies will lose out to firms that don’t buy into the phony green investment schemes and instead continue making money the old-fashioned way—profiting from efficiency and innovation in response to market signals while using cheap energy—and get higher profits for their shareholders and pension plans.

The Heartland Institute has been fighting crony capitalism for decades. In recent years, Heartland has become actively engaged in pushing back against efforts by federal and state governments to make liberal politics instead of profits the mandatory metric for business success. We submitted testimony opposing plans by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to force all publicly traded companies to detail and report on any possible future climate-related risks they may face. We supported efforts by the Trump administration to prevent the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) from denying services such as lending and payment processing to companies doing business in industries progressives don’t like, such as fossil fuels and firearms, as opposed to normal fiscal and business considerations. Heartland stoked opposition to Saule Omarova, the Cornell University law professor whom President Joe Biden nominated to run the OCC, because of her statements supporting a government takeover of all private banking and her stated hostility to the oil and gas industry. Facing almost certain defeat in a Senate confirmation vote, Omarova withdrew her nomination.

The Biden administration nonetheless seems intent on forcing publicly traded businesses to adopt its government-approved ESG policies and making sure banks do business only with companies in industries the government approves of. Firearms manufacturers, fossil fuel companies, and other disfavored enterprises need not apply.

Some states have leaped ahead of the federal government. Maine was the first state to adopt a fossil fuel divestment policy, with Gov. Mills signing such a law last June. It requires the state pension fund to eliminate all fossil fuel investments by 2026. Virginia’s legislature is considering two bills (SB 213 and HB 640) that would authorize but not dictate that state and local retirement boards divest from “fossil fuel companies.” The bills state this includes companies involved in coal, oil, and natural gas exploration, production, and distribution. Lawmakers in New York, Oregon, and Vermont are considering or developing similar divestment legislation.

Politico has taken notice of The Heartland Institute’s efforts to defeat mandatory woke, anti-fossil-fuel investment strategies. In a recent article it complained that The Heartland Institute, among other pro-liberty, limited-government organizations, is having success in some state capitals fighting efforts to impose a mandatory net-zero carbon dioxide economy on everybody.

Heartland and our allies believe private pension funds and those that manage them should be guided first and foremost by fiduciary responsibilities to retirees and investors. This means pursuing profits instead of the progressive political causes dear to the hearts of the many liberal CEOs of banks, investment funds, and stock traders. Putting profits first provides best for the well-being and retirement security of the people who have entrusted their money with those money managers and companies. We believe businesses, investors, and private individuals should make up their own minds about whether to embrace the green economy, how much to fear or anticipate climate change, and indeed whether to fear, anticipate, or take it into account at all. Government bureaucrats should not be allowed to substitute their judgement about business and investment opportunities for those of the business owners and investors who have put their time and money into these enterprises.

As Politico notes, The Heartland Institute’s efforts are bearing fruit in some state capitals. States have barred cities from banning new fossil fuel use within their borders. Some states, such as Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia, have moved to prevent official state government business from being conducted with banks or investment management firms that divest from fossil fuels or use their market power to force other businesses to do so. Texas, for example, passed a law requiring state entities, including pension funds and the state’s substantial K-12 school endowment, to divest from companies that boycott or cut ties with fossil fuel producers. To carry out that law, the state is compiling a list of companies, which includes BlackRock, that will no longer be allowed to manage the state’s pensions, and banks that will not be allowed to underwrite state or municipal bond offerings.

More recently, the West Virginia Board of Treasury Investments, which is charged with managing about $8 billion in operating funds for the state, informed BlackRock it would no longer do business with the company because the company’s bias against fossil fuels comes at the expense of West Virginia’s economy and U.S. economic and national security.

Public pension plans across the country face a variety of challenges on an ongoing basis. The number of retirees is growing, and ever-more promises are being made to them. Employees and retirees are right to be concerned about the future of their pensions, but it is the taxpayers who will foot the bill for those poor public policy decisions. The fate of these pensions, and the burden on taxpayers, will only be made worse if politicians continue to push politically correct ESG policies that undermine profit, financial security, and fiscal soundness.

Research makes clear divesting from fossil fuels is a costly investment strategy. A report from the economics and regulatory consulting firm Compass Lexecon states the costs of divesting from fossil-fuel-related companies are substantial in terms of the return on a portfolio of investments. Specifically, the study shows less-diverse investment portfolios are exposed to higher risk and commonly suffer lower returns on investment. From 1965 through 2014, diversified portfolios that included fossil-fuel and utility stocks experienced an average annual return above 6.5 percent, the study found. The return for diversified portfolios without fossil-fuel or utility stocks was only 5.8 percent, a reduction of 0.7 percentage points per year, amounting to trillions of dollars in lower returns during that time.

Forcing public pension plans to divest from fossil fuel companies places significantly more risk on the long-term health of public pension plans than prior divesture efforts such as tobacco, nuclear weapons, and firearms. Those industries are niche sectors of our economy. The fossil fuel industry is large and will continue to play an important part in our economy for generations, despite the wishes of climate scolds. Often overlooked is this fact: any transition to renewable energy sources will require fossil fuels as a backup.

The vast majority of public pension plans are already substantially underfunded. Removing such a significant segment of our economy from public pension plans would only make a bad situation worse, making it that much harder to generate the investment return benchmarks our public pensions need to fulfill their promises to retirees.

It is important to understand how public pension plans work. Unlike the 401(k)s most of us are familiar with, a public pension plan is a promise to public employees that once they retire, they will receive a set monthly pension benefit for the rest of their lives. This promise must be met regardless of whether there are enough assets in the plan. If the assets in the pension plan are not enough to meet those promises, taxpayers are obligated to pick up the difference. Fossil fuel divestment increases the likelihood taxpayers will have to bail out public pension plans.

Anti-carbon-dioxide initiatives in the Northeast have already led to soaring electricity prices and home heating costs. Consumers are paying the price this winter, and fossil fuel divestment will only push taxes higher when the bill to make good on governments’ pension promises is delivered.

Fossil fuel divestment and other efforts to decarbonize our economy may warm the cockles of some peoples’ hearts, but they won’t warm anyone’s home. Instead, they will cost people dearly, through higher utility bills now and higher taxes in the future.

Shifting Gears, EU Declares Natural Gas and Nuclear Green … Evidence Shows Weather Is Not Getting More Extreme

SHIFTING GEARS, EU DECLARES NATURAL GAS AND NUCLEAR GREEN

In an apparent bow to reality, the European Union (EU) has proposed natural gas and nuclear energy be counted as sustainable technologies. This would qualify them for use in meeting the trading bloc’s climate emission reduction goals.

This is a sharp about-face for the EU, as it and several of its member nations had previously demanded cutting natural gas use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and not counting nuclear power as clean energy.

Deutsche Welle (DW) reports the European Commission is putting in place a “taxonomy,” “a classification system, establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities,” which “could be described as the EU’s green investment rulebook, intended to serve the goal of allowing the continent to become climate neutral by 2050.”

European Green Party representatives in the EU Parliament and in EU member countries have labeled the Commission’s move backsliding. The Greens claim the change would undermine the EU’s commitment to the Paris climate agreement.

However, the degree to which this proposal will reverse the energy woes induced by Europe’s climate policy is an open question. The devil is in the details.

DW describes those details as follows:

[T]he EU Commission stated that certain strings remained attached. For example, gas plants could only be considered green if the facility switched to low-carbon or renewable gases, such as biomass or hydrogen produced with renewable energy, by 2035. Nuclear power plants would be deemed green if the sites can manage to safely dispose of radioactive waste. So far, worldwide, no permanent disposal site has gone into operation though.

Without a relatively rapid transition to biomass or hydrogen and an acceptable way to store spent nuclear fuel, neither natural gas nor nuclear will qualify as sustainable for more than a few years. The current status of those fuel sources not counting toward carbon dioxide reduction targets would resume thereafter.

The EU Commission proposes the new taxonomy as a “delegated power,” meaning unanimity of all member states is not required. Under the delegated power system, the proposal becomes law if 20 EU countries or a simple majority of European Parliament members approve it. It is now up for review by the 27 EU member states and the European Parliament.

EVIDENCE SHOWS WEATHER IS NOT GETTING MORE EXTREME

New research published in European Physical Journal Plus finds there has been no measurable increase in the number or intensity of extreme weather events.

A team of researchers from universities and research centers in Italy reviewed the academic literature discussing extreme weather events and compared it to various time series data sets measuring different types of extreme weather across five different subsystems of the climate: the atmosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. They used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s definition of extreme weather: “extreme weather events are events rare at a particular place and time of the year. Definitions of rare event vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations.”

The scientists’ summary of the evidence speaks for itself:

[G]lobal trends in heatwave intensity are not significant. Daily precipitation intensity and extreme precipitation frequency are stationary in the main part of the weather stations. Trend analysis of the time series of tropical cyclones show a substantial temporal invariance and the same is true for tornadoes in the USA. At the same time, the impact of warming on surface wind speed remains unclear. The analysis is then extended to … indicators of extreme meteorological events, namely natural disasters, floods, droughts, ecosystem productivity and yields of the four main crops (maize, rice, soybean and wheat). None of these response indicators show a clear positive trend of extreme events. In conclusion on the basis of observational data, the climate crisis that, according to many sources, we are experiencing today, is not evident yet.

To sum up on “disasters,” accumulated real-world data does not show cyclones, droughts, extreme precipitation events, floods, heat waves, hurricanes, or tornadoes have become more frequent or intense.

The best protection from extreme weather is wealth, the scientists note. They quote a 2019 study that found a “clear decreasing trend in both human and economic vulnerability, with global average mortality and economic loss rates that have dropped by 6.5 and nearly 5 times, respectively, from 1980–1989 to 2007–2016. We further show a clear negative correlation between vulnerability and wealth, which is strongest at the lowest income levels.” In addition, the researchers write, “global yields of maize, wheat, rice, soybean and barley have on average increased by 217–297% from 1960 to today” even as acreage devoted to growing these crops has been stable for approximately 50 years.

As important as findings of this report are, their conclusion is even more profound:

From the Second World War, our societies have progressed enormously, reaching levels of well-being (health, nutrition, healthiness of the places of life and work, etc.) that previous generations had not even remotely imagined. Today, we are called to continue on the path of progress … dictated by the fact that the planet is about to reach 10 billion inhabitants in 2050, increasingly urbanized.

Since its origins, the human species has been confronted with the negative effects of the climate; historical climatology has repeatedly used the concept of climate deterioration in order to explain negative effect of extreme events (mainly drought, diluvial phases and cold periods) on civilization. Today, we are facing a warm phase and, for the first time, we have monitoring capabilities that enable us to objectively evaluate its effects.

Fearing a climate emergency without this being supported by data, means altering the framework of priorities with negative effects that could prove deleterious to our ability to face the challenges of the future, squandering natural and human resources… . Whether or not we manage to drastically curtail our carbon dioxide emissions in the coming decades, we need to reduce our vulnerability to extreme weather and climate events.

I couldn’t agree more.

Electric Power Reforms Gain Ground in Virginia,David Wojick,"Two big Bills designed to fix Virginia’s broken electric power system have cleared the first legislative hurdle, on the road to becoming law. Both of these Virginia House Bills were approved by the cognizant Subcommittee of the House Commerce and Energy Committee.

HB 118 fully repeals the damaging (and nutty named) Virginia Clean Economy Act. VCEA foolishly mandates the complete elimination of fossil fueled electric power by 2045, with forced plant retirements beginning in 2023. The full Bill is here: https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB118.

HB 73 amends VCEA to eliminate many of its worst features. You can read it here: https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB73.

Strategically it is often easier to amend a law than to repeal it. As Jefferson Institute policy analyst and power guru Steve Haner puts it, HB 118 is a hammer while HB 73 is a scalpel.

Both Bills next go to the full Committee, then if passed to the full House. Both were approved on straight party votes and the Republicans have just taken control of the House, so prospects for one or both passing are pretty good. The real fight is likely to be in the Senate where the Democrats still have a slim majority.

For this reason the proponents of VCEA repeal or reform are gearing up to get the word out. CFACT is a big part of this effort, because VCEA is arguably the worst alarmist power law in America. In fact CFACT President Craig Rucker testified at the Subcommittee hearing in favor of HB 118.

I myself filed the following Comment on HB 118, challenging Virginia’s giant electric power company Dominion, to provide an honest assessment of VCEA’s damaging cost and unreliability.

“Dominion has no plan that complies with VCEA and provides reliable electricity. In their 2020 IRP they said they would have to import up to 10,000 MW in winter because solar was completely unreliable. But then in their 2021 IRP Update they say that imports like this are not feasible because everyone is going solar. The only alternative is huge amounts of storage, hundreds of thousands of MWh, costing hundreds of billions of dollars, but their plan only provides 16,000 MWh. It is completely unreliable, beginning next winter. VCEA simply cannot work. See my article for details: https://www.cfact.org/2022/01/21/vcea-makes-virginias-electric-grid-dangerously-unreliable/“

Several CFACT analysts besides me have done detailed analyses of VCEA’s absurd consequences. Just use the search feature at CFACT on VCEA.

Another excellent resource is the “Repeal The Virginia Clean Economy Act” website at https://repealvcea.com/. Of particular interest is a county by county breakdown of the nearly 800 square miles of solar slabs now in the VCEA development lineup. Repeal VCEA senior adviser Collister Johnson led off the Subcommittee testimony for HB 118.

Unfortunately the short Virginia legislative session is a mad scramble, with hundreds of Bills under cursory consideration. Those of you who live in Virginia, or have contacts there, are urged to take quick action. Letters, phone calls, or even brief emails to Senators are most important at this time.

If the green Democrats manage to block meaningful electric power reform this session you may be sure our fight for sanity will continue. But now is the time to push and push hard.

This is not just a Virginia issue. As Governor Youngkin has said, it is time to “change course on electric power”. This is certainly true for all America, and for the whole world. It is time to steer away from renewable madness.

Biden is disconnected from American’s reluctance to be regulated out of fossil fuel prosperity,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","Civilization has benefited from more than 6,000 products made from the oil derivatives manufactured out of raw crude oil at refineries. None of these products were available to society before 1900. With no known replacement for crude oil in the foreseeable future, President Biden has stated “we are going to get rid of fossil fuels” implying that he is going to change society’s lifestyle and economy demands for the products made from fossil fuels that were not available before 1900.

Virtually all the components of wind turbines, solar panels, and all forms of transportation are assembled with products made from oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil. Ridding the world of crude oil would eliminate most forms of transportation and electricity generation from wind and solar.

The public has demonstrated that they are not going to be mandated and regulated away from using the products essential to maintaining their basic standard of living and keeping the prices for thousands of everyday goods and services low as it would reverse most of the progress humanity has made over the last century. Those products made from fossil fuels and the inventions of the automobile, airplane, and the use of petroleum in the early 1900’s led us into the Industrial Revolution and victories in World Wars I and II.

President Biden appears to be disconnected from most Americans, as he must be oblivious to his own Environmental Information Agency’s (EIA) Jan 11, 2022, report that US Fossil Fuels Production to Reach Record Highs in 2023. Biden may be sabotaging the American economy with shortages and inflation in the name of unattainable climate targets and may go down in history as causing the continent to be homage to China for the materials to go green, and to Russia and OPEC for crude oil.

His continuous use of executive orders, regulations, and policies to alter the social demands of society for Americans to live without reliable and affordable power supplies – supplies critical to peace, prosperity and the survival of Western civilization, and the products and infrastructures made possible from fossil fuels is not working. The shortages and inflation upon society with his tinkering of the supply chain of fossil fuels is not working as shown by his own EIA agency.

Under the Biden multiple restrictions on domestic oil production and climate plan, America will be discouraging U.S. energy independence, starting with tightening restrictions on fossil fuel development by suspending Federal Oil and Gas Permits, encouraging the shuttering, and halting of further fracking efforts in America, and the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline.

To reduce civilization’s demands for fossil fuels will require significant social changes to reduce the need for so many products, reduce flights, and reduce the need for so those products to be moved around the world. Only by reducing the demand, can we reduce the supply. There is no need whatsoever for the supply of fossil fuels if it were not for the demands of society, but the public remains unwilling to be mandated and regulated into an inferior lifestyle

Just changing vehicles from fossil fuel energy to electrical energy, i.e., electric vehicles or EV’s, is a significant change, but in perspective, just a minute social change, as the world will still need to implement significant demand reductions of the thousands of products from crude oil, and the fuels for airlines and merchant ships from the other half of the barrel of crude oil. Kneecapping abundant U.S. crude oil production is next-level stupidity from whoever is advising the President.

The cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline increased world emissions, and costs to Americans, as that Canadian crude oil is now being transported to the West coast where it is then shipped hallway around the world to China. After China manufacturers the crude oil into usable products, in a country will significantly less environmental controls that America, those products are then shipped back to America via air polluting ships to West Coast ports, for American consumption.

The domino effect of tinkering with the supply chain of fossil fuels is supply shortages and soaring prices for not only electricity, but for the thousands of products that support the entire medical industry, all branches of the military, airports, electronics, communications, merchant ships, container ships, and cruise liners, as well as asphalt for roads, and fertilizers to help feed the world.

Who knows, but efforts to cease the use of crude oil would be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change. It would result in billions of fatalities from disease, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths. Imagine the cold, misery, and loss of life under a scenario where cities attempt to generate 100 percent of their electricity from breezes and sunshine.

Indeed, the primary usage of crude oil is NOT for the generation of electricity, but to manufacture derivatives and fuels which are the ingredients of everything needed by our economies and lifestyles to exist and prosper. Energy realism requires that the legislators, policymakers, and media, most of whom demonstrate a pervasive ignorance about crude oil usage, start to understand the staggering scale of the decarbonization movement.

Skyrocketing costs of electricity due to the intermittent generation from breezes and sunshine inflict massive damage on the less fortunate as an unwanted regressive expense. In addition, Biden’s “green want-to-be” government remains oblivious to United Nations warnings about the negative consequences of the demand for exotic minerals and metals for wind, solar, and EV batteries that includes worldwide ecological degradation and atrocious human rights abuses.

Renewables have a role to play in our energy usage. But we need to consider what they can do and what they cannot. Science shows that wind and solar can generate electricity, albeit intermittently, but science also shows us that wind and solar CANNOT manufacture the oil derivatives that are the basis of thousands of products we now take for granted.

Depriving its citizens of the more than 6,000 products that were non-existent before 1900, made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, as President Biden is planning to do, is evil and immoral as extreme shortages and further inflation will result in fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths.

The call to action is for President Biden to attain some energy literacy before he does irreparable harm to the U.S economy and the nations’ national security for energy.

"Climate Model Problems Persist, Changes Reduce Accuracy Further",H. Sterling Burnett,"In the past week, two more articles have been added to the growing body of literature discussing the fact that climate models have consistently failed to project the Earth’s temperatures and temperature trends accurately, since their inception.

As if that were not bad enough, The Wall Street Journal and Powerline report climate models’ projections of future temperatures have gotten worse over time. As new generations of supposedly improved climate models are produced and refined, the accuracy of their temperature simulations decreases. Each new generation of general circulation models fails to track or correspond to a greater degree with measured temperature changes and trends than the previous generation.

This makes a joke of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) claims that climate models have improved, which in normal discourse would mean they’ve become more accurate.

Every time the IPCC issues a new report, from the first (CAR1) issued in 1990 through its Sixth and most recent Assessment report (CAR6) released in August 2021, it claims the newest generation of models it uses is more accurate than the prior generation. The “Summary for Policy-Makers” for CAR3 stated, “Confidence in the ability of models to project future climate has increased.” Yet, instead of narrowing the range of future possible temperatures from the previous report, the range nearly doubled. That’s like doubling the size of the bulls-eye on a target, barely hitting the outside edge of the larger bullseye, and claiming it’s a sign the shooter’s accuracy has increased.

The IPCC’s CAR6 reports states,

“These models include new and better representation of physical, chemical and biological processes, as well as higher resolution, compared to climate models considered in previous IPCC assessment reports. This has improved the simulation of the recent mean state of most large-scale indicators of climate change and many other aspects across the climate system.”

How can their simulations be “improved” when, as I discussed in Climate Change Weekly 407, the modelers themselves were forced to admit, just weeks before CAR6 was released, that the models were projecting even hotter temperatures and steeper temperature trends than the previous iteration, the simulated temperatures of which were already too hot, failing to represent measured temperatures accurately?

Only a government bureaucracy or a con artist could claim with a straight face a technology has improved when it does not perform its required task as well as poor-performing previous versions. It’s like confidently asserting a class of electric vehicles is improving based on laboratory modelling even as the miles they can travel between recharges is declining and the amount of time it takes to recharge them is getting longer. Worse performance is not better, unless the goal is to fail.

The fact that computer models are flawed and produce untrustworthy climate projections has long been recognized. Reports by the National Center for Policy Analysis (which I edited when I worked there) in 2001 by environmental scientist Kenneth Green, Ph.D. and in 2002 by David Legates, Ph.D. (who was then the director of the Center for Climatic Research at the University of Delaware-Newark) detailed the numerous flawed projections computer models had made, and they explained why the failures occurred and were likely to continue to be the norm.

Legates wrote,

Models are limited in important ways, including: an incomplete understanding of the climate system,

an imperfect ability to transform our knowledge into accurate mathematical equations,

the limited power of computers,

the models’ inability to reproduce important atmospheric phenomena, and

inaccurate representations of the complex natural interconnections. These weaknesses combine to make GCM-based predictions too uncertain to be used as the bases for public policy responses related to future climate changes.

Whereas computing power has improved markedly over time, modelers’ knowledge of the myriad factors and interconnections that drive climate change has not. In part, this is because the IPCC has always focused on understanding the human factors that affect climate, to the exclusion of other factors, even though it admits other factors do have some effect.

To their credit, CARs 1 through 5 acknowledged that natural factors—the Sun, clouds, ocean currents, etc.—play at least some role in climate change, however poorly understood at the time. The IPCC has provided lists of factors, natural and human, that affect temperatures. The list has changed over time, as have the estimates of the direction the various factors drive temperature and by what amount. What never changes, however, is the amount of confidence or degree of understanding the IPCC has about the temperature effects of non-anthropogenic factors, because study of these is largely ignored. Previous CAR reports consistently admitted the IPCC had low or very low understanding of each of the natural factors that drive temperature changes. Nonetheless, the IPCC has been confident in dismissing them as significant sources of present climate change.

That is like trying to understand how a car functions, admitting you know nothing about radiators, alternators, timing belts, oil pumps, and myriad other systems, but being confident that having a full tank of gasoline and a key in the ignition are the only real factors that make a car function. Then, when the car doesn’t start, you state with confidence the only reason it could have failed was because the key was broken or the car was out of gas.

The IPCC got away with this nonsense by claiming that when they run their models without carbon dioxide it does not produce the warming they expect, regardless of changes in assumptions about the other factors, but when they add carbon dioxide, the models produce significant warming. That’s circular reasoning at best and idiotic at worst. It should not surprise us that the assumptions modelers make about carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions are the only ones that produce the results they expect and are getting.

In CAR6, the IPCC abandons even the appearance of scientific curiosity about nonhuman factors’ effects on climate. If you read only AR6’s summary for policymakers, you wouldn’t know clouds existed unless humans caused them by creating aerosols. Yet water vapor is by far the dominant greenhouse gas, accounting for more than 97 percent of all the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and clouds have huge long-term and short-term effects on surface temperatures. The IPCC acknowledged as much in previous AR reports, admitting climate models account poorly for the role changes in cloud cover play in climate change.

AR6 virtually ignores any effect the Sun has on climate change. The report barely acknowledges solar irradiance as having any role at all in climate change, in a graphic on page SPM-8 (Summary for Policy Makers). There is no mention of solar cycles, which we know from history correlate with climate changes. Nor does the report even mention that increases and decreases in cosmic rays resulting from solar fluctuations affect cloud cover and thus temperatures. Except for volcanoes, all other factors—such as large-scale decadal ocean circulation patterns—are lumped into a category called “Internal Variability” to which AR6 attributes almost no effect on climate change.

Climate modelers’ response to the fact that their models perform poorly and their performance has worsened over time is not to admit it is a matter of “Garbage in, Garbage out” that should lead them to question their fundamental assumptions about whether human greenhouse gas emissions are the sole or even dominant factor driving temperature changes. Instead, as The Wall Street Journal reports,

They reworked 2.1 million lines of supercomputer code used to explore the future of climate change, adding more-intricate equations for clouds and hundreds of other improvements [emphasis mine]. They tested the equations, debugged them and tested again. The scientists would find that even the best tools at hand can’t model climates with the sureness the world needs as rising temperatures impact almost every region.

That’s right, climate modelers’ response to the consistent failure of their models to reflect real climate conditions is to spend more money and time adding complexity to their models. Complexity is not in and of itself a virtue.

The climate system is certainly complex. Even so, there is no reason to believe making models more complex will make them more accurate. We don’t adequately understand all the factors that drive climate changes or how the Earth responds to different perturbations on the overall climate. What one doesn’t understand, one can’t model well. Absent that basic understanding, adding more lines of code and making increasingly complex assumptions about climate feedback mechanisms that are even more poorly understood than the basic physics only makes models more error-prone. Every line of code and every complex calculation is one more area, formula, or operator where a flawed assumption or simple mistake of math or code punctuation can cascade throughout the model. Complexity introduces more opportunities for errors or “bugs” in the code, which can throw off the projections.

The fact that as modelers make their models increasingly complex their simulated climate outputs increasingly diverge from real-world climate data should serve as an indicator complexity is a weakness of the models. Modelers simply don’t know what they don’t know. That’s a fact they should admit, instead of building their ignorance into their models by pretending elegant mathematical formulae reflect reality simply because they are elegant and complex. The first step in getting out of a hole you have dug is to stop digging.

A second indicator that complex climate models are inherently flawed is the fact that simpler climate models perform better in matching real-world temperature data. Simple models reject assumptions about how different aspects of the climate system will add to or reduce relative warming as greenhouse gas emissions rise. Absent the additional forcing from modeled feedback mechanisms or loops, simple models project a modest warming in response to rising emissions. In this respect, the simple models reflect well what Earth has actually undergone.

There has been no runaway warming, and there is little or no reason to expect such a thing to occur from any reasonably expected future rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. If models don’t get right their basic projections—temperatures—there is no reason to trust their ancillary or projected secondary effects which are supposed to be driven by rising temperatures.

DISASTER LOSSES DECLINING AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP … CORAL COLLECTION GREATER THREAT TO CORAL THAN CLIMATE CHANGE

DISASTER LOSSES DECLINING AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP

Roger Pielke Jr., Ph.D., reports U.S. losses from natural disasters have declined as a percentage of overall economic outputs, measured as gross domestic product (GDP), as documented by the U.S. disaster loss database at the Center for Emergency Management and Homeland Security at Arizona State University. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) uses the university’s Spatial Hazard Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUS) data set to estimate expected annual losses from disasters in the United States.

Based on SHELDUS’s data, FEMA estimates that when all the loss numbers are finally in, disaster losses in the United States in 2021 will be around $141 billion.

That would confirm what other data sources have reported: since 1990, there has been a significant downward trend in U.S. disaster losses as a proportion of U.S. GDP (see the figure below), as monitored by the Office of Management and Budget, despite tremendous population growth and land-use development.

Pielke points out the United Nations’ preferred methodology for calculating disaster costs is as a fraction of GDP , per the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction

The declining disaster losses in the United States are part of and consistent with a “broader global trend of declining vulnerability to weather and climate extremes, which has been documented around the world and for a wide range of weather and climate phenomena,” Pielke writes.

Did you miss the headlines announcing disaster costs were falling amid climate change? I know I sure did. Instead, I am constantly barraged with headlines claiming disaster costs are rising and setting records because global warming is causing more extreme weather, with no recognition of context, population and demographic trends, or price inflation.

CORAL COLLECTION GREATER THREAT TO CORAL THAN CLIMATE CHANGE

With the Australian government announcing plans to spend $1 billion to save the Great Barrier Reef from bleaching ostensibly caused by global warming, and maintain its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Jennifer Marohasy, Ph.D., notes approximately 200 tons of coral from the reef, in addition to sea life interacting with it, are being dug up each year as part of the aquarium trade. As an aside, additional thousands of tons are excavated each year to satisfy the international demand for coral jewelry.

Marohasy notes the amount of coral removed represents only a small amount of the reef as a whole, yet it is likely to be more than is replanted with the government’s $1 billion in funds.

This is on top of $443 million Australia’s government granted to the small but politically connected Great Barrier Reef Foundation for research, protection, and recovery efforts in 2018. That grant set aside more than $86 million for administrative expenses.

How will the money be spent? Some of it will go to go to a consortium committed to replanting corals, creating jobs for scuba divers, and charter boats, Marohasy writes. Their work will be filmed by underwater videographers, and marine scientists will participate in, monitor, and collect data.

It is unclear whether any money will go to those gathering and providing coral for the foreign aquarium trade, but Marohasy writes,

… an October 2021 assessment of the Queensland Coral Fishery by the federal Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment explains there is a quota of 200 tonne total allowable catch, split between ‘specialty coral’ (30 per cent) and ‘other coral’ (70 per cent).”

Many of the corals are listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The assessment report does mention that there is some concern around the lack of harvest limits for CITES-listed coral species and the lack of adequate mechanisms to enforce harvest limits. It also explains that the take of corals has been increasing.

Interestingly, all this money is being spent to save the Great Barrier Reef from death induced by climate change even though the data indicate the Great Barrier Reef is doing well, with most of its coral successfully recovering from the limited bleaching it experienced in recent years.

Nor, based on historical records, have ocean temperatures where the reef resides increased over the past 150 years, as reported at Climate Realism:

Temperatures are monitored at eighty sites within the Great Barrier Reef by the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences, and individual records do not show a long-term warming trend. There are no studies showing either a deterioration in coral cover or water quality.

In short, it seems all this money is being spent to satisfy UNESCO and a small but vocal group of politically connected researchers who say global warming is threating the Great Barrier Reef, without any confirming evidence.

Texas Remains in Peril,Donn Dears,"It has been one year since the devastating blackouts in Texas, so it’s time to examine whether Texas is in danger of repeating the disaster.

Winterization

Winterization was one of the issues raised as a cause of the blackouts.

The adequacy of winterization plans for natural gas power plants won’t be known until after September 2022, when a statewide mapping of the electric supply chain is completed.

It’s also unclear whether natural gas pipeline pumping stations have been added to the critical infrastructure list. Not being on that list resulted in electricity being cut to pumping stations last year, which cut the supply of natural gas to power plants.

Reserve Margins

There were insufficient reserve margins before last year’s blackouts.

Wind and solar installations were included in reserve margins even though it’s impossible to guarantee they can generate significant quantities of electricity.

This chart from three years ago predicted that reserve margins in 2021 would be essentially zero when electricity from wind and solar was unavailable.

Only baseload power plants, i.e., dispatchable power, should be included in reserve margins. Natural gas, coal, and nuclear are the only types of power generation that can be relied on 24/7 throughout the year, assuming the plants are properly maintained, including winterization.

(A few states can rely on hydro or geothermal, but they are not available in Texas.)

Baseload power plants can have breakdowns which is one of the reasons for reserve margins. The other reason for maintaining reserve margins is that demand can also exceed previous peaks, such as unexpected air conditioning or heating loads.

Reserve margins protect against unusual peaks in demand and unforeseen equipment failures.

Wind and solar are unreliable and cannot be included in reserves.

One would think it would be easy to determine whether Texas has adequate reserve margins for this winter.

Unfortunately, data provided by ERCOT is specious, and it’s likely that Texas lacks adequate reserve capacity.

Is ERCOT’s published reserve margins of 41.2% realistic for the winter of 2022? See red arrows.

Why would ERCOT publish such an unrealistic reserve margin?

Did ERCOT expect the media to repeat the information? And for the public to be comforted by the news?

Note that peak demand was based on “normal weather”. But reserve margins are to protect against abnormal weather.

Note also that wind and solar are included as available supplies. These are bracketed by the red square in the accompanying table from the ERCOT report.

ERCOT determines reserve margins by subtracting Firm Peak Load Forecast from Total Capacity and dividing the result by the Firm Load Forecast. (See black arrows in the accompanying table.)

Subtracting wind and solar from available capacity establishes a reserve margin of 24%.

A similar process using ERCOT’s summer data arrives at a negative reserve margin for the summer months.

Wind and solar cannot be used as reserve capacity because wind and solar are unreliable. There is no sunshine at night, and there are multiple days where the wind doesn’t blow strongly enough, i.e., over ten mph, to generate meaningful amounts of electricity.

This is what happened in the winter of 2021 when a high-pressure zone stalled over the entire mid-continent of North America.

Chart from Gregg Goodnight’s Heartland presentation.

The reserve margin calculation is distorted by using Firm Load Forecast instead of the peak load actually experienced by ERCOT.

In last years’ disaster, the peak load was around 76,800 MW, approximately 16,000 MW higher than the Firm Load Forecast used by ERCOT to calculate this winter’s reserve margin. (Top arrow in accompanying table.)

Using the 2021 peak load of 76,800 MW, which is the least that should be expected in any future storm, and using total capacity without wind and solar, results in a reserve margin of 0.4%.

In other words, ERCOT’s realistic reserve margin for this winter is nearly zero.

In a special note, ERCOT says:

“Nearly 85,000 MW of resource capacity is expected to be available for the winter peak. This amount is all operational capacity.”

This includes wind and solar, presumably, as there is no comment to the contrary.

Additions to ERCOT Grid

ERCOT continues to add large amounts of wind and solar, while adding only small amounts of baseload power.

SOURCE

Conclusion

ERCOT continues to add wind and solar, ignoring the need for baseload power.

It’s uncertain whether the winterization of natural gas power plants and pipelines will be completed before the winter of 2023.

Based on information published on the ERCOT website, ERCOT has insufficient reserve capacity to prevent a disaster this year if there is a severe winter storm.

Texas will continue to live with the constant threat of disasters unless ERCOT revises its policies. Adding more baseload power would be an essential first step.

We Should Not Compare Electricity Sources Using Nameplate Ratings,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","Comparing nameplate ratings of various electrical generating powers sources is comparable to using IQ as the only or most appropriate measure of the value of an employee to the company he or she works for… If everyone had the same health level, skill set, and work ethic, it might suffice. But we don’t. And neither do different kinds of power plants.

For those of us who focus on the costs and benefits of various kinds of power plants within a grid system, it appears there has been an orchestrated effort through media, advertising, and public relations – even government agencies – to mislead the public about the value proposition of wind and solar.

One of the most glaring examples is the persistent use of “nameplate rating” (generating capacity) of breezes and sunshine as a benchmark of value and comparison. Nameplate rating itself is not a reflection of the contribution of energy or reliability to a grid system.

In the 20th century “nameplate rating” was a reasonable proxy for contribution to meeting peak demand whenever that peak may occur. Put another way, all prevalent power plant types could be turned on and run – up to their “nameplate rating” – whenever they were needed (aside from scheduled time for major maintenance or upon some small chance of unexpected breakdown) because they were able to manage their fuels.

For these tried-and-true technologies whose fuel availability is determined by human ingenuity and learning/adapting, it is common to de-rate nameplate rating by only about 10 to 15% to arrive at a “capacity value” or “system adequacy contribution” value (in reliable, on demand watts). This value for each power plant is added together across a system and the sum expected to meet maximum system demand (called peak load) with about ten to fifteen percent more as a “reserve margin” to avoid potential blackouts caused by unexpected generator outages or unexpected high demand.

The amount of reserve margin is a trade-off between the risk of black-outs (and other system reliability issues) and costs. So “right sizing” system “adequacy” is important to keeping electricity rates low because power plants cost far more to build and maintain than all the fuel they will ever consume over their lifespans. Accordingly, too many power plants are indeed too many because they are expensive to build, and therefore they rely on adequate revenue from their productivity to pay for themselves and produce a return on investment over several decades.

A 90 percent System Adequacy Contribution per watt of Nameplate Rating is fair and common across conventional types from coal to gas to nuclear. But wind and solar are different compared to technologies that have ‘Firm’ capacity. Their “fuels,” solar radiation and breezes, cannot be managed – i.e., consistently delivered and converted to electricity – and will never be. This is especially critical at the times demand is greatest. Therefore, they do not significantly replace the most expensive component of the cost of electricity: dispatchable power plants. Instead, they sap market share, gross margin percentages and revenue from the dependable fleet they can only pretend they can replace.

Just as problematic as renewables’ fundamental inability to generate at highest demand times is that these “intermittent fueled generators” often generate most when less power is needed by society, creating an undervalued market price for all electricity producers – sometimes lower than it costs them to generate (known as marginal cost), and far lower than the all-in cost to maintain system adequacy considering loan payments, payroll and other monthly expenses which must be met by all power plants.

For wind and solar “nameplate rating” is neither a measure of expected electricity generation over time nor their contribution to system reliability. Yet time and time again we see government entities, grid operators and especially news media spouting GENERATING CAPACITY (nameplate rating) in comparisons with conventional generating technologies.

We should not compare electricity sources using nameplate ratings

Using nameplate capacity to compare technologies is misleading people into believing that weather dependent electricity can “replace” technologies that can manage their fuels when they cannot. This kind of reporting and public relations is, intentionally or not, biased toward intermittent generation. It’s sad when done by the media and public relations, and worse when done by a government agency.

However, with respect to cost comparison, US Department of Energy EIA states it clearly in their annual levelized cost of electricity reports, imploring:

“The duty cycle for intermittent renewable resources, wind and solar, is not operator controlled, but dependent on the weather or solar cycle (that is, sunrise/sunset)..(and so) their levelized costs are not directly comparable to those for other technologies..” ……………………………..

PJM, the largest wholesale electricity market operator in the world seems to agree in this statement describing the priorities in their most recent renewables transition study: “Correctly calculating the capacity contribution of generators is essential: A system with increased variable resources will require new approaches to adequately assess the reliability value of each resource and the system overall.”

This speaks directly to the importance of accurate system adequacy contribution comparisons between different generating technologies as the headline metric of value – instead of nameplate rating.

The correct two metrics of comparison between intermittent and dispatchable power plants that should supersede the use of nameplate rating are:

1) system adequacy contribution (in MWs) and

2) annualized electric energy generation (in MWhs)

Unfortunately, as PJM indicates, the methods of estimating system adequacy contribution are also controversial. The most widely used metric is “the old approach”, or ELCC (effective load carrying capability). That metric would be helpful if all generating technologies were symbiotic and not parasitic. In other words, ELCC fails to consider that wind and solar readily depress the financial viability of the existing dispatchable fleet that renewables require to remain, and that ELCC uses as a basis for the calculation of the system adequacy contribution of the “parasitic” renewables! In essence the metric isn’t well suited for an energy mix where competitive technologies aren’t direct substitutes for each other. ELCC is subtly circular in its reasoning since renewables have become politically favored into deployment and undermine the financial solvency of dependable power plant investments.

A better way of estimating system adequacy contribution looks at recent historical generating patterns of renewables in the context of the load patterns and amplitudes they might serve, independent of the existing generation mix. We favor one called “Mean of Lowest Quartile generation across peak load hours (MLQ) suggested by the market Monitor in its 2012 SOM report on MISO.

In using the wrong bases of comparison between power plant types, governments, market operators and image-obsessed companies are ignoring prudent economics and physics, placing the importance of the notion of a cleaner, self-sustaining world dependent on the weather for power ahead of real priorities like an affordable, abundant, and reliable electricity grid system, in accordance with FERC’s mission, to support human flourishing.

Renewables only “take root” because governments, market operators, utility regulators and misguided Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors – misguided only in that they do not account for how the Grid actually works, as discussed above – seek an unrealistic pace and impetus of “energy transition.” These push modern civilization toward reaching an economy like we had in the 1800’s and prior – the last time the world was “decarbonized”.

Assessing Virginia’s Hidden Wind and Solar Costs,Paul Driessen,"Among Governor Glenn Youngkin’s first actions was Executive Order #9 initiating Virginia’s withdrawal from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Northeastern US “carbon market” that sets and enforces emission limits for coal and gas power plants. RGGI also lets utilities buy “carbon credits” when emissions exceed those limits, and pass costs on to families, businesses, hospitals and schools.

Special interests will contest withdrawal, but the EO sets the proper tone for reforming Virginia’s energy system. Meanwhile, though, the 2020 “Virginia Clean Economy Act” still requires that utility companies close all fossil fuel generating plants – and replace them with wind and solar power by 2045.

The VCEA also stipulates that “not less than 5,200 megawatts” (rated capacity) of that “clean, renewable” power must come from offshore wind. That translates into 370 14-MW turbines, 430 12-MW turbines or 865 6-MW turbines off the Virginia coast. Construction of the first 180 has already hit cost overruns and could reach $10 billion.

The offshore turbines will supposedly power 660,000 homes. But that will happen only when winds are blowing at speeds required for full rated capacity, perhaps 40-45% of the year, sporadically and unpredictably. When winds do not cooperate, Virginia will need backup power.

So the VCEA says utilities must “build or acquire” 3,100 “megawatts” (megawatt-hours?) of “energy storage.” This likely means battery modules. If Tesla 85-kilowatt-hour modules are used, some 37,000 would be needed – to provide several hours or days of electricity requirements, depending on how widespread a blackout might be following a hurricane or other storm, or simply amid inadequate wind.

Virginia’s carbon-free energy plan doesn’t contemplate new hydroelectric or nuclear power. It mostly means thousands of onshore and offshore wind turbines and millions of solar panels, covering 10-25 times the area of Washington, DC – depending on the types of turbines and mix of wind and solar power. Hundreds of miles of new transmission lines will bring this far-flung electricity to Virginia urban centers.

Threats to raptors and other birds, bats, whales, dolphins and other wildlife are significant. But the act “declares” that all these installations are “in the public interest,” because they will help “combat climate change.” That suggests that environmental reviews could be fast-tracked and cursory.

That cannot be permitted. Indeed, the realities of wind, solar and battery power demand that any assessment of their supposed “clean, renewable and sustainable” virtues be global in its scope. Land use, pollution and human rights issues surrounding these highly touted energy sources affect people, habitats and wildlife all over Virginia, the USA and the world, in significant, disparate and disproportionate ways.

Wind and sunshine certainly are clean, renewable and sustainable. However, harnessing them to meet society’s huge and growing energy needs is not.

Wind, solar and battery facilities can be deemed clean, renewable and sustainable in Virginia, if land use, scenic, wildlife, infrasound, light flicker and other impacts are ignored. However, they require greatly increased mining, fossil fuel use, emissions and environmental impacts in China and other countries that provide most of the raw materials and manufacturing for these technologies.

A recent International Energy Agency report says onshore wind turbines require nine times more raw materials per megawatt than combined-cycle gas generating plants. Offshore turbines require 14 times more materials. Solar panels and backup battery modules also require prodigious amounts.

Virginia’s 5,200 MW of offshore wind alone will require nearly 20,000 tons of copper. At an average of 0.44% copper in ore deposits worldwide, the copper alone would require mining and processing 4.5 million tons of ore, after removing some 7 million tons of overburden to reach the ore bodies.

A single 3-MW onshore turbine foundation needs 600 cubic yards (1,500 tons) of concrete, plus rebar.

These technologies also require vast amounts of steel, aluminum, lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earth metals, plastics, fiberglass and other materials – all of which involve extensive drilling, mining, processing, manufacturing and shipping. Because the United States increasingly restricts or prohibits such activities, or regulates them into unprofitability, most of that work is now done in China or by Chinese companies in other countries – using fossil fuels, and under pollution control, mined-land reclamation, workplace safety, and child and slave labor standards far below what US laws permit.

Coal and gas-fired generating units typically operate at nearly full nameplate capacity for 40 years or more; nuclear power plants for decades longer. Onshore wind turbines, solar panels and battery modules may have 15 to 20-year life spans; offshore wind turbines far less than that, because of salt corrosion. Their efficiency, electricity output and already-low reliability also decline from Day One.

Virginians need to know: How much electricity will these VCEA-mandated facilities actually generate every day, week and year? Who gets to decide where they go? What are their expected life spans, especially for offshore turbines? How many could be destroyed in a hurricane, tornado or ice storm? How long will it take to repair or replace them? Where will electricity come from in the meantime?

Since most of their systems and components cannot be recycled, where will the obsolescent or ruined turbines, turbine blades, solar panels, batteries, power lines and concrete foundations be disposed of? How much will the repair, replacement, removal and landfilling cost? Who will pay?

How will wildlife habitats, raptors, bats, and other rare and endangered species be protected as these industrial-scale installations proliferate? What fines and penalties will be assessed for violations?

How many tons of metals, minerals and other materials will be required to build all these “clean economy” facilities? How many tons of ore will have to be mined? How many tons of overburden removed? How much coal, oil, diesel and natural gas fuel will be involved? How much land?

Will Virginia actively campaign to have more US lands opened to exploration, mining and drilling for these materials, so that Virginia and the United States are not 90-100% dependent on China, Russia and other often less-than-friendly foreign sources for these essential materials and technologies?

How many African, Asian, Uighur and Latin American children and parents will work in the mines, processing plants and factories that provide these “clean, green” technologies? How will Virginia ensure workplace health and safety, fair living wages and human rights for them?

The VCEA was promoted as a solution to “dangerous manmade climate change.” In evaluating the global costs and benefits of energy programs initiated under the act, how many tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be emitted by all these overseas operations?

Under this law, Virginia will shut down some 6,000 megawatts of coal-based electricity generation. But China already had 900,000 MW of coal-fired power plants, put another 380,000 MW into operation in 2020, and is financing or building hundreds of coal and gas power plants in Asia and Africa.

China alone will soon have 200 times more coal-fired generation than Virginia will

eliminate – plus all the fossil fuel units it is building in other countries. Chinese units will improve people’s living standards – and build “clean, renewable” energy equipment for export.

What specific global greenhouse gas emission, land preservation, wildlife, climate change and extreme weather benefits will the VCEA actually generate (assuming CO2 actually drives climate and weather)?

A Youngkin-appointed commission could study all these matters. Its findings could help determine whether the Virginia Clean Economy Act can possibly deliver on its promised benefits; whether the global damages actually exceed any Virginia, US or global benefits; and whether the VCEA should be modified, or repealed outright.

The time to act is now – before this wind, solar and battery “transformation” is any farther along.

We Should Not Compare Electricity Sources Using Nameplate Ratings,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","Comparing nameplate ratings of various electrical generating powers sources is comparable to using IQ as the only or most appropriate measure of the value of an employee to the company he or she works for… If everyone had the same health level, skill set, and work ethic, it might suffice. But we don’t. And neither do different kinds of power plants.

For those of us who focus on the costs and benefits of various kinds of power plants within a grid system, it appears there has been an orchestrated effort through media, advertising, and public relations – even government agencies – to mislead the public about the value proposition of wind and solar.

One of the most glaring examples is the persistent use of “nameplate rating” (generating capacity) of breezes and sunshine as a benchmark of value and comparison. Nameplate rating itself is not a reflection of the contribution of energy or reliability to a grid system.

In the 20th century “nameplate rating” was a reasonable proxy for contribution to meeting peak demand whenever that peak may occur. Put another way, all prevalent power plant types could be turned on and run – up to their “nameplate rating” – whenever they were needed (aside from scheduled time for major maintenance or upon some small chance of unexpected breakdown) because they were able to manage their fuels.

For these tried-and-true technologies whose fuel availability is determined by human ingenuity and learning/adapting, it is common to de-rate nameplate rating by only about 10 to 15% to arrive at a “capacity value” or “system adequacy contribution” value (in reliable, on demand watts). This value for each power plant is added together across a system and the sum expected to meet maximum system demand (called peak load) with about ten to fifteen percent more as a “reserve margin” to avoid potential blackouts caused by unexpected generator outages or unexpected high demand.

The amount of reserve margin is a trade-off between the risk of black-outs (and other system reliability issues) and costs. So “right sizing” system “adequacy” is important to keeping electricity rates low because power plants cost far more to build and maintain than all the fuel they will ever consume over their lifespans. Accordingly, too many power plants are indeed too many because they are expensive to build, and therefore they rely on adequate revenue from their productivity to pay for themselves and produce a return on investment over several decades.

A 90 percent System Adequacy Contribution per watt of Nameplate Rating is fair and common across conventional types from coal to gas to nuclear. But wind and solar are different compared to technologies that have ‘Firm’ capacity. Their “fuels,” solar radiation and breezes, cannot be managed – i.e., consistently delivered and converted to electricity – and will never be. This is especially critical at the times demand is greatest. Therefore, they do not significantly replace the most expensive component of the cost of electricity: dispatchable power plants. Instead, they sap market share, gross margin percentages and revenue from the dependable fleet they can only pretend they can replace.

"Biden Climate, Energy Policies’ Costs: High and Rising",H. Sterling Burnett,"In Climate Change Weekly 419, I detailed some of the policies Joe Biden has imposed as president that have contributed to higher energy prices and the inflation affecting other goods and services now plaguing average American households.

“[Climate change is] the number one issue facing humanity. And it’s the number one issue for me,” said Biden.

Among the steps Biden has taken to fight climate change: he cancelled the Keystone XL pipeline partnership with Canada, on his first day in office, possibly the first time in history a president used his first day in office to kill thousands of American jobs and disrupt critical infrastructure; shortly thereafter, Biden imposed a moratorium on new oil and gas leases on federal lands and on the U.S. outer-continental shelf. Since then, Biden has cancelled oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; proposed methane emission restrictions that would make it harder and more expensive to develop, store, and transport oil and natural gas in the United States; proposed increasing the fees and royalty rate oil and gas producers must pay the federal government; and recently announced plans to foreclose drilling on more than half of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.

Biden’s efforts to fight climate change by hammering U.S. production of fossil fuels have resulted in dramatically higher fuel and food prices. Energy is the master resource, the lifeblood of the economy. Energy abundance and the low prices it brings create jobs and keep the economy humming. Biden has ignored this fact to the detriment of consumers, employers, homeowners, and, importantly to his party’s sinking electoral prospects, voters.

How bad is it? How much have energy prices risen since Biden entered office and started waging his war on domestic energy? My colleague at The Heartland Institute, energy and environment Research Fellow Linnea Lueken, has crunched the numbers for a forthcoming Heartland Institute publication. This is what she found during Biden’s first year in office:

Residential electricity prices rose 11.3 percent.

Natural gas prices rose 86.34 percent.

Regular gasoline prices have risen by 42 percent and diesel rose by 38.9 percent.

These are just the current, known results of Biden’s energy policies. When one recalls Biden has pledged to implement policies to reach 100 percent “carbon” pollution-free electricity by 2035 and to reach net-zero emissions nationally by 2050, it is obvious these higher prices are just a small down payment on Biden’s ultimate energy plans.

While running for president, Biden claimed his comprehensive climate and energy plans would cost $2 trillion in just four years. As high as this figure is— equivalent to five times the amount that consumers and industry currently spend annually on electricity—it pales in comparison with estimates recently calculated by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.

McKinsey’s report, “The Net Zero Transition,” provides a detailed analysis of the costs involved in hitting net zero by 2050.

The report states the economic cost of the transition will be a staggering $275 trillion by 2050, or approximately $30 billion per day for the next 25 years. With an almost laughable degree of understatement, the McKinsey reports states, “our estimates of the annual spending on physical assets for a net-zero transition exceed to a meaningful degree the $3 trillion–$4.5 trillion total spending estimates that previous analyses have produced.”

As high as these figures are, McKinsey admits its analysis is not comprehensive:

In particular it does not focus on such issues as technology breakthroughs, physical constraints related to scale-up capacity and the availability of natural resources, delayed-transition costs, the role of adaptation, or other imponderables or uncertainties, nor have we yet modeled the full range of economic outcomes likely under a net-zero transition. As a result, it is likely that real outcomes will diverge from these estimates, particularly if the net-zero transition takes a more disorderly path or restricting warming to 1.5°C proves unachievable. Spending requirements could be higher, for example due to the additional investment needed to maintain flexibility and redundancy in energy systems, or heightened physical risks and commensurate adaptation costs.

Nor does McKinsey’s report address the kinds of political losses that, based on past experience, one should expect to occur in the process of implementing a large-scale makeover of the energy system underpinning the economy, via special-interest lobbying and the operation of government itself. For every significant policy change, those who expect to be harmed or disadvantaged and those who expect to benefit from or be advantaged by it devote massive amounts of money and resources to shape the legislation as much as possible in their favor. In addition, significant money, resources, and manpower are diverted to government agencies to establish rules and mandates for the transition, monitor its implementation and measure its results, and police the programs and punish lawbreakers.

Losses to transaction costs are high for every significant piece of legislation. How much higher will they be for the kind of comprehensive, economy-wide redesign necessary to reach net zero?

To some degree, McKinsey’s analysis presents a best-case scenario: the costs of hitting net zero will be $275 trillion by 2050 “if all goes right, the transition is smooth with no unexpected technological failures or resource shortages, no cheating, and government operations are efficient.”

McKinsey writes,

The net-zero equation remains unsolved…, nor is the world prepared to complete the net-zero transition. … Nor would execution be easy: solving the net-zero equation cannot be divorced from pursuing economic development and inclusive growth. … It could also have knock-on impacts on the economy more broadly, potentially creating a backlash that would slow down the transition. … Achieving net zero would mean a fundamental transformation of the world economy, as it would require significant changes to the seven energy and land-use systems that produce the world’s emissions: power, industry, mobility, buildings, agriculture, forestry and other land use, and waste.

Is that all we’d have to do?

Even this dramatic economic overhaul may not be enough to prevent the supposed climate crisis.

“First, it is not clear whether a 1.5°C scenario is achievable in the first place, nor what pathway the world would take to achieve it if it were,” writes McKinsey. “Indeed, even if all net-zero commitments and national climate pledges were fulfilled, research suggests that warming would not be held to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels….”

A forced economic transition greater than any in history, at costs exceeding any in history and far above what has been previously estimated; that’s what net zero requires. Even so, the result is likely to be for naught, with the dreaded 1.5℃ temperature rise still exceeded.

The good news is that the massive forced transition to net zero is not necessary, even if it were possible and governments and industries could be relied on to carry it out efficiently and without corruption.

As shown in the myriad fact sheets provided at Climate at a Glance, extreme weather is becoming neither more common nor more severe, and a modest 1.5℃ temperature rise does not threaten to destroy either human civilization or the Earth. The Earth abides, and humans have lived through more severe and dire climate changes in the past than any that could reasonably be expected to result from rising greenhouse gas emissions in the future.

CHINA’S GREAT LEAP FORWARD WITH NUCLEAR … MEDIA IGNORES DECLINING TEMPERATURE ANOMALY … BIOMASS IS NOT GREEN, S&P SAYS

CHINA’S GREAT LEAP FORWARD WITH NUCLEAR

China is taking the lead on new nuclear energy technologies, leaving the United States and other countries lagging while burnishing its climate leadership credentials.

Reuters reports the state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) launched the first commercially active high-temperature gas-cooled “pebble bed reactor” (PBR) nuclear power plant in the eastern coastal province of Shandong.

The CNNC connected the 200 megawatt Shidaowan reactor to the grid in mid-January. A second unit is under construction.

“In PBR technology, the reactor core is formed from graphite pebbles that contain specially designed fuel particles,” explains Reuters. “The design allows reactors to be run safely at higher temperatures, CNNC said, describing it as ‘the reactor that won’t melt down.'”

The reactor, 93.4 percent of which was sourced domestically, is one of six the CNNC has proposed to construct over the next decade.

In addition to introducing the first PBR into commercial operation, China has also constructed a new, nuclear-power-driven heating design in Shandong. The project extracts the residual steam under high pressure from the nuclear power unit as a heat source, and after going through a multistage heat exchange through the power station, transfers the heat to residential homes through the municipal heating pipeline network.

According to the Global Times, China claims this co-generation project, along with similar projects being developed around the nation, will improve the use efficiency of power plants and help the country achieve its strategic goals of “carbon peak and carbon neutrality.” The recent co-generation project replaced 12 local coal-fired water boilers, providing non-carbon-dioxide-emitting heat to 200,000 residents in Haiyang. China claims this makes Shandong the first “zero carbon” residential heating city in China.

MEDIA IGNORES DECLINING TEMPERATURE ANOMALY

An analysis of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) year-end global climate report published on Watts Up With That shows NOAA’s report hides more than it reveals. NOAA claims the 2021 global temperature anomaly was the sixth-highest of its recorded measurements.

“The year culminated as the sixth warmest year on record for the globe with a temperature that was 0.84°C (1.51°F) above the 20th century average,” NOAA states. “The years 2013–2021 all rank among the ten warmest years on record.”

Analyst Larry Hamlin points out NOAA downplayed the fact that the 2021 global temperature anomaly measurement marked the sixth year of decline in the temperature anomaly. The decline has persisted despite a measured increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

The six-year temperature anomaly decline measured by NOAA is confirmed by the temperature anomaly data sets provided by NASA, the UK Met Office, the University of Alabama at Huntsville, and the Remote Sensing System analysis (see the graphs below). Every major temperature measuring system relied upon by alarmists to proclaim unprecedented warming is in the offing, threatening a climate emergency, has displayed a declining trend in the temperature anomaly over the past six years. This data is in stark contrast with the consistent upward trend projected by the climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This declining trend has occurred even as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations grew from 402 ppm to 417 ppm as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory.

After examining NOAA’s monthly data closely, Hamlin concludes it “clearly establishes that the monthly and annual global temperature anomaly measurement behaviors are strongly controlled by El Niño and La [Niña] events which are naturally occurring climate phenomena and not driven by man made contributions to atmospheric CO2 levels.”

If Hamlin is correct, natural cycles, not human greenhouse gas emissions, have dominated global temperature trends for the past six years at least. If this is true for the past six years, why not think, as many scientists have suggested, nature has been in control across the whole past 150 years, during which the Earth has experienced alternate periods of warming, cooling, warming, relative stasis, warming, and now cooling again?

BIOMASS IS NOT GREEN, S&P SAYS

The S&P Global Clean Energy Index removed British energy giant Drax from its portfolio after it determined the company wasn’t producing carbon-neutral or clean energy.

The Drax group, which produces 5 percent of the electric power used in the United Kingdom, vowed to become the world’s first carbon-negative energy company by 2030. Drax’s promise was to be met through its operation of power plants burning wood pellets to replace coal in generating electricity. Drax has already converted four of six electricity generating units from coal to wood pellets.

Drax is not the first biomass-burning energy company S&P booted from its Global Green Energy Index. It had previously removed French biomass burner Albioma from the list.

Numerous studies show burning biomass is neither green nor clean.

“Biomass generally benefits from confusion over two vastly different terms that often are used interchangeably: ‘renewable’ (or sustainable) and ‘carbon free,'” writes science journalist Michael Fumento in The American Conservative. “Both appeal to the touchy-feely, warm and fuzzy set, but they are not necessarily the same.”

Although biomass can be renewable, burning it is not carbon neutral.

Research shows biomass burning often produces as much or more of traditional regulated air pollutants as coal while wiping out thousands of acres of wildlife habitat. In addition, the claimed carbon dioxide neutrality is vitiated by the emissions from creating the pellets from virgin wood and scrap material, shipping it from overseas, and, most importantly, because even when trees are planted to replace those harvested to burn in power plants (and they aren’t always), any emissions removed happen over decades if not centuries, whereas the emissions from burning the wood pellets are produced immediately.

In the here and now, biomass burning emits “65 percent more carbon dioxide per megawatt hour than modern coal plants and an amazing 285 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas combined-cycle power plants,” writes Fumento.

A study published in Environmental Research Letters calculated the payback time for forests in the eastern United States, where most of the biomass burned by Drax and others comes from. Under the best-case scenario—when all harvested land is reforested and is allowed to regrow to maturity—burning wood pellets creates a carbon deficit, carrying a payback time of between 44 and 104 years.

"Ottawa, Canada is following Germany’s failed climate goals","Ronald Stein, P.E.","Shockingly, just to reduce emissions to supposedly stop climate change, the city of Ottawa, Canada is following the lead of Germany, Australia, and California that now have among the highest costs for electricity because of their decarbonization efforts.

Ottawa is prepared to bankrupt the city and risk the safety of its most vulnerable citizens to put their plans in place to achieve its “net-zero by 2050” target, regardless of its impact on the lifestyles of its citizens.

The City is totally in sync with the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investments that are all the rage on Wall Street these days. Political leaders like Al Gore, billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, and more than 180 CEOs signed the Business Roundtable corporate purpose statement supporting ESG goals to divest from all 3 fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil, just to reduce emissions.

The domino effect of tinkering with the supply chain of fossil fuels is supply shortages and soaring prices for not only electricity, but for the thousands of products that support the entire medical industry, all branches of the military, airports, electronics, communications, merchant ships, container ships, and cruise liners, as well as asphalt for roads, and fertilizers to help feed the world.

What’s Ottawa’s motivation for encouraging deterioration of the oil infrastructure that is guaranteed to inflict irreparable harm to the supply chain of crude oil to refineries that manufacture oil products for the world’s infrastructures and it’s 8 billion people?

Who knows, but efforts to cease the use of crude oil would be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change. It would result in billions of fatalities from disease, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths. Imagine the cold, misery, and loss of life under a scenario where cities attempt to generate 100 percent of their electricity from breezes and sunshine.

The ESG factors apparently driving Ottawa’s agenda and that of the banking industry are an attempt to bring us back to a world like that in the 1800’s when the world was truly “decarbonized.” Back then, life was hard and dirty, and most people never traveled more than 100-200 miles from where they were born. With no coal or natural gas power plants, life expectancy was short and we had not discovered that crude oil could be manufactured into so many of the vitally important products that we take for granted today.

Indeed, the primary usage of crude oil is NOT for the generation of electricity, but to manufacture derivatives and fuels which are the ingredients of everything needed by our economies and lifestyles to exist and prosper. Energy realism requires that the legislators, policymakers, and media, most of whom demonstrate a pervasive ignorance about crude oil usage, start to understand the staggering scale of the decarbonization movement.

Europe’s obsession with breezes and sunshine has sent electricity prices rocketing. The average cost of electricity for delivery in the short term soared to record levels in 2021, rising over 200 per cent in Germany, France, Spain, and the UK, largely due to their excessive reliance on wind and solar power.

The electricity crunches in Germany, Australia, and California are straining budgets and has become one of the biggest political challenges to protect vulnerable citizens and mid-sized businesses from price increases, fueling (no pun intended) inflation just as governments contend with the spread of the omicron virus variant.

Skyrocketing costs of electricity due to the intermittent generation from breezes and sunshine inflict massive damage on the less fortunate as an unwanted regressive expense. In addition, “green want-to-be” governments like that of the City of Ottawa remain oblivious to United Nations warnings about the negative consequences of the demand for exotic minerals and metals for wind, solar, and EV batteries that includes worldwide ecological degradation and atrocious human rights abuses.

They also appear ignorant of the fact that at least 80 percent of humanity, or more than 6 billion people, are now living on less than $10 a day and billions have little to no access to electricity. They would love to have the fossil fuels that have so blessed our societies. Yet Canadian and American politicians are pursuing the most expensive ways to generate intermittent electricity from wind and solar power, while subsidizing the working poor to hide the real costs of their plans. Third-world governments cannot subsidize themselves out of a paper bag. Their poor must bear the brunt of any virtue signaling their governments might engage in.

No wonder India, China and other coal-dependent developing nations rejected developed countries’ attempts to commit them to phasing out “unabated” coal-fired power at the UN’s climate change meeting in Scotland. India’s Minister for Environment and Climate Bhupender Yadav put it well:

“How can anyone expect that developing countries can make promises about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when developing countries still have to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication?”

Similarly, Chinese COP26 Delegate Li Zheng asserted,

“To demonize fossil fuel will only hurt ourselves.”

In addition, Asians and Africans, many of them children from the poorer and less healthy countries, are being enslaved and are dying in mines and factories to obtain the exotic minerals and metals required for the green energy technologies Ottawa politicians and other western leaders so favor. The 2-minute video from Planet of the Humans illustrates the “blood minerals” needed for EV batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines.

Renewables do have a role to play in our energy usage. But we need to consider what they can do and what they cannot. Science shows that wind and solar can generate electricity, albeit intermittently, but science also shows us that wind and solar CANNOT manufacture the oil derivatives that are the basis of thousands of products we now take for granted.

Depriving its citizens of the more than 6,000 products that were non-existent before 1900, made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, as so many politicians across the developed world are planning to do, is immoral as extreme shortages will result in fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths.

As the City of Ottawa pursues electrification of it grid from breezes and sunshine, and electrification of all of its vehicles, at any cost, it remains oblivious to the real world needs of its citizens.

Teachers and Students Finally Given Access to the Truth About Climate Change,James Taylor,"One of the most insidious developments that has occurred over the past decade has been the extent to which mainstream media outlets and government-run schools and colleges have acted in concert to deprive the American public—especially young people—of access to objective information about climate change.

A whole generation is being brainwashed into believing long-debunked assertions about an impending “existential climate crisis,” the presence of ever more severe hurricanes and tornadoes, rapidly rising sea levels, and countless other dubious predictions of future climate calamities.

Moreover, the vast majority of America’s youth are completely ignorant about the fact that tens of thousands of scientists believe— and, even more importantly, mountains of scientific evidence show—that humans are not creating an existential climate change crisis.

We will not stand by and watch as this problem persists. On the contrary, The Heartland Institute is taking bold action to provide American students with the truth about global warming and climate science.

In October 2021, at Heartland’s 14th International Conference on Climate Change, we unveiled one of our most important climate initiatives to date: a book for teachers and students titledClimate at a Glance for Teachers and Students: Facts for Climate Realists on 30 Prominent Climate Topics. This lesson book presents scientifically compelling summaries of 30 common climate change topics in a manner that is concise and easy to understand. The 30 summaries present compelling arguments about the reality of hurricanes, droughts, coral reefs, and Earth’s temperature history, among many others. Each summary is between two and four pages, with many including visually appealing graphics that illustrate the main point of the summary. Each summary is an ideal length for a short, yet compelling, daily lesson.

The public school establishment has shut out climate realism from mainstream textbooks and teaching materials. That, however, does not mean climate truth must concede defeat. In 2017, Heartland sent more than 300,000 copies of Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming to middle school, high school, and college science teachers throughout the country. Some teachers ignored the book. Some teachers literally burned the book. Yet, many other teachers used the book as a valuable resource to provide their students with much-needed balance on the global warming topic. We know this because many teachers thanked us for producing and providing the book.

The leftist media and the climate establishment collectively lost their minds and maliciously attacked Heartland after we distributed Why Scientists Disagree. They did so because they realized that piercing their monopoly of alarmist messaging to students is the biggest threat to the left’s climate agenda.

The Heartland Institute will never be bullied into silence. Our children are our future and we have a duty to ensure that they learn the truth, not climate dogma. So, Heartland just ordered a first print run of 100,000 copies of Climate at a Glance for Teachers and Students, and when we receive the physical copies, we will send them to a list of 100,000 high school and middle school science teachers. As we receive donations for additional copies, we will send copies of our lesson book to our full distribution list, which includes all members of Congress and every state legislator in the country.

Additionally, we have made a digital copy of the book available, free of charge, to the general public. We are spreading the word to parents and students so that they can access the best and most objective scientific lessons on climate change topics with the click of a mouse, even if their particular public school teacher refuses to present those lessons.

It is easy to become discouraged when we see America’s youth subjected to a blackout of objective climate science in government-run schools. But with your help, Heartland will continue to enlighten American students with the truth about climate change.","January 28, 2022",OPED,Heartland,https://heartland.org/opinion/teachers-and-students-finally-given-access-to-the-truth-about-climate-change/
“ESG” = Extreme Shortages Guaranteed!,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","The Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors climbing up the agenda in the banking industry would have banks divest in fossil fuels. This would lead toward a world like that in the 1800’s, the last time the world was “decarbonized”.

Back in the 1800’s, we had no coal or natural gas power plants, and we had not discovered crude oil as something that could be manufactured into usable products. Life was hard and dirty, and most people never traveled 100-200 miles from where they were born, and life expectancy was short.

Today, there is a lost reality that the primary usage of crude oil is NOT for the generation of electricity, but to manufacture derivatives and fuels which are the ingredients of everything needed by economies and lifestyles to exist and prosper. Energy realism requires that the legislators, policymakers, and media that demonstrate pervasive ignorance about crude oil usage understand the staggering scale of the decarbonization movement.

The efforts to cease the use of crude oil could be the greatest threat to civilization, not climate change, resulting in billions of fatalities from diseases, malnutrition, and weather-related deaths.

In the worldwide frenzy to achieve the goal for “net zero” emissions, over the last 5-10 years, “ESG”–standing for Environmental Social Governance–has gone from an acronym that virtually no one knew or cared about, to a cultishly embraced top priority of financial regulators, markets, and institutions around the world. Today, the ESG divesting efforts are applying to all 3 fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil.

The Net-Aero Banking Alliance developed with the support from the United Nations, now includes seven of the largest and most influential banks in the United States, including BOA, Citi, J.P. Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and Amalgamated Bank.

Allowing banks to collude to reshape economies so that they are in line with the preferences of banks and other financial institution is a very dangerous precedent. The American people never voted to give banks this sort of control over our country.

The domino effects from tinkering with the supply chain of crude oil, is supply shortages and soaring prices for thousands of products that support the economies of the world. Products based on oil are the basis of the entire medical industry, all branches of the military, airports, electronics, communications, merchant ships, container ships, and cruise liners, as well as asphalt for roads, and fertilizers to help feed the world. Fossil fuel shortages encourage inflation as it imposes serious damage on the energy and raw materials infrastructures.

Climate alarmism seems to be inexhaustible and if history is any guide, ESGers admitting their mistakes and rushing to undo the damage is not at the top of the list of likely responses. Thus, by divesting in crude oil infrastructure we can look forward to supply shortages of thousands of products manufactured from oil and crippling power prices and unreliable supplies to meet the demands of society.

The oil products that reduced infant mortality, extended longevity to more than 80+ and allowed the world to populate from 1 to 8 billion in less than two centuries, is now required to provide the food, medical, and communications to maintain and grow that population. How can world leaders consciously support the demise of crude oil that would take us back to the 1800’s when life was hard, dirty, and short?

Today, with all the products manufactured from oil, according to the United Nations the global population of centenarians 100 years old or older is projected to grow from more than 500,000 in 2021, to exceed 2 billion in 2050.

We already know that the poorer developing countries, currently without the usage of the 20th century products manufactured from crude oil, are experiencing about 11,000,000 child deaths every year due to the unavailability of the fossil fuel products used in wealthy countries.

More than 70 per cent of those child fatalities in developing countries are attributable to six causes: diarrhea, malaria, neonatal infection, pneumonia, preterm delivery, or lack of oxygen at birth. About 29,000 children under the age of five – 21 each minute – die every day, mainly from preventable causes.

Without replacements for those derivatives manufactured from crude oil, there will be gigantic reductions in living standards of the population in the current healthy and wealthy countries as the world migrates back to the pre-1900 era, and any attempt to develop the colonial countries would come to a dead stop.

“Net zero” will be taking us back to a time before 1900 when the world had not yet discovered the benefits to society from the 3 fossil fuels. Net-zero policies are demonstrably precipitating ever more serious, unsustainable socio-economic and environmental damage, with several advanced economies routinely experiencing blackouts, and steeply escalating electricity prices that are leading to class-based electricity poverty, excess winter deaths, organized social and political pushback and ever more violent confrontations.

Before the 1900’s we had NONE of the products used in the medical industry nor any of the 6,000 products from oil and petroleum products. By ceasing oil production and fracking, the supply chain to refineries will be severed and there will no need for refineries as they will have no crude oil supply to manufacture derivatives and into transportation fuels demanded by the world’s heavy-weight and long-range infrastructures of aviation, merchant ships, cruise ships, and militaries.

Divesting is already impacting supply shortages of jet fuel as reported by Energy Information Administration (EIA), as less production and more demand have reduced U.S. jet fuel inventories since 2014 for the 23,000 commercial airplanes and 20,000 Private jets.

The IEA report points out that the demand growth for plastics and fertilizer are outpacing the demand growth for steel, aluminum, and cement. Petrochemical product demand has nearly doubled since 2000 and the U.S. and Europe use twenty times as much plastic and ten times as much fertilizer as India, Indonesia, and other developing countries on a per-capita basis. A decarbonized world without the three fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and crude oil CANNOT manufacture any of those petrochemicals from a wind turbine or solar panel.

As Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) divesting in fossil fuels progresses, the short memories of petrochemicals’ golden goose contributions to societies are leading the world to an era of Extreme Shortages Guaranteed (ESG) like we had in the decarbonized world in the 1800’s!

Bringing Britain’s Woes to America?,Paul Driessen,"Virginia enacted a Clean Economy Act; other states have implemented similar laws. AOC demands a national Green New Deal; President Biden is imposing one via executive decree. The United Kingdom is determined to reach Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions; the European Union is pursuing a Green Deal.



All these policies send energy prices rocketing upward, eliminating jobs and killing people. Instead of reducing emissions, they simply move them overseas, where they combine with massive air and water pollution, habitat destruction and wildlife decimation – as China and other countries burn more coal, oil and gas every year, to improve their people’s living standards … and to mine and process raw materials for the wind turbines, solar panels and battery modules they manufacture for climate-obsessed nations.



The net result: Progress toward global Net Zero is zero – worse than zero – and all the lost jobs, rising poverty, reduced living standards and policy-driven deaths are for nothing.



President Biden wants hydrocarbon-free electricity generation by 2035, and elimination of all fossil fuel extraction and use by 2050. That means no gasoline or diesel vehicles; no natural gas to power factories or heat, warm water and cook in homes, hospitals and businesses; no petrochemical feedstocks for fertilizers, plastics, pharmaceuticals and thousands of other essential, everyday products.



All US energy will be provided by wind, solar and battery power – millions of wind turbines, billions of solar panels and billions of battery modules, sprawling across continental United States and along its coasts. Petrochemicals will come from crops planted on millions of acres of former wildlife habitat.



To drive this extreme agenda, Team Biden has canceled pipelines, leases and permits; pressured banks to stop lending money for drilling; and issued scores of regulations that delay and drive up costs for fossil fuel projects – while making it easy for industrial-scale wind and solar installations to get permits. Prices for energy, transportation, food, services and used cars predictably shot up. Inflation and consumer prices reached 40-year highs.



Henry Hub natural gas prices doubled from $2.61 per mcf (thousand cubic feet or million BTUs) in November 2020 to $5.51 in October 2021, before falling to $4.75 in January 2022, as skyrocketing global prices spurred drilling, fracking and production on US state and private lands. Regular gasoline averaged $2.17 a gallon nationwide in 2020 – but hit $3.39/gal ($4.38 in California) in the same timeframe.



As Americans fret and fume over the needlessly high prices – and wonder what the future might hold – they can look to the UK and EU (a) to count their blessings for comparatively low prices today and (b) to ponder how continued climate-centric policies could impact American livelihoods and living standards.



Britain and continental Europe have already embraced a wind-and-solar future, closed coal and nuclear power plants, and banned fracking for the trillions of cubic feet of natural gas beneath their feet, while North Sea production keeps falling. They have reaped the whirlwind from those callously inept policies.



(It is illuminating and ironic that Russian organizations finance many US, UK and EU anti-fracking disinformation campaigns, funneling funds through a Bermuda law firm, a shell company and the Sea Change Foundation to the Sierra Club, Climate Action Network and other groups.)



Britain and Europe’s vaunted wind turbines have been generating electricity at a dismal 14% of “nameplate capacity” – providing power three hours a day, one day a week, four days a month, in short spurts, at completely unpredictable times. Their wintertime solar power has been equally sporadic and unpredictable. No modern society can function on such energy.



The huge gaps have been plugged with gas- and coal-fired generation, with much of the gas coming from Russia and the USA. But Asia also wants the gas, and Russia is playing Ukraine/Nord Stream 2 pipeline politics with its gas, tightening supplies as demand soars. UK and EU home and business gas and electricity prices are in the stratosphere – five to ten times the Biden Era prices Americans are paying.



Luckily for families and businesses, Britain’s Office of Gas & Electric Markets (Ofgem) regulates how much utility companies can charge. But that often means keeping household, hospital, school and business energy prices well below the utilities’ actual costs – with predictable results.



Experts say the average annual household bill of £1,277 ($1,755) could surge to £1,865 ($2,530) when the current price cap is raised in April 2022 – for homes and apartments that are much smaller than US counterparts, in a climate with much less extreme summer and winter temperatures than in much of the United States. Annual bills could exceed £2,000 ($2,715) or much more at Ofgem’s August review.



National Energy Action says this could put more than 6 million UK households (nearly one-fourth of all households) in “fuel poverty” – unable to afford proper heat, and often having to choose between heating or eating, even when cold indoor temperatures put their health and lives at risk.



For families that want budgetary certainty, the average 12-month fixed deal for a typical household now costs almost £2,500 ($3,430). But the UK’s second-biggest energy supplier’s most recent fixed-rate offer is almost £4,200 ($5,750)! That’s because natural gas and electricity generation costs are expected to keep rising – and because utilities must pay wind turbine operators “constraint payments” to turn turbines off whenever they generate more power than the grid needs and can absorb!



The month-ahead natural gas price at the Dutch TTF hub (a European benchmark for trading gas) recently hit €93.3 ($107) per megawatt-hour. That’s $31 an mcf – more than six times the January 2022 Henry Hub price. Just a month earlier, the European day-ahead gas price reached $61 per mcf!



No wonder 30 UK energy suppliers went bankrupt by the end of 2021 – leaving families and businesses scrambling to find new suppliers, at skyrocketing prices for heating and cooking. When utilities cannot charge customers anywhere near operating costs, they go belly-up.



No wonder two-thirds of UK renters struggle to pay their energy bills, and 400,000 more UK households were in danger of losing their gas and electricity provider before last Christmas. People are “genuinely terrified” about rising energy costs. Excess winter energy-poverty death tolls are likely to set new records.



Health and living standards in Britain and Europe will likely get far worse. In addition to insane energy costs, wages and environmental regulation costs are much higher than in Asia. Ceramic, steel, aluminum, automotive and other energy-intensive companies and industries are becoming uncompetitive. Manufacturing, jobs, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are just moving to Asia.



Climate and energy politics, combined with fierce global demand, make it unlikely that Europe’s energy prices will go down. And while the EU recently voted to define natural gas and nuclear power as “sustainable,” acquiring affordable gas and building new nuclear plants will take years and be battled every step of the way. Rolling blackouts could become as common as in California.



British politicians “rail at energy costs” and argue about trimming them at the margins, says journalist Madeline Grant, perhaps by reducing the 5% VAT on energy or the 25% green-social subsidy levies on electricity bills. But they “dare not question the green policies” that cause energy price increases, end up taking no action, and then slap hefty new “pollution taxes” on gas and diesel vehicles.



Britain and Europe need to drill and frack their vast shale deposits. Having shut down their older nuclear plants, they must start building small modular reactors. The rest of the developed world needs to take similar actions – and not only because China, India and the rest of the developing world are not about to give up fossil fuels and rely on unreliable wind and solar power, but to save jobs and lives.



Otherwise, Britain’s Christmas just past will be its, Europe’s and America’s Christmas future, forever. Scrooge learned from Marley. Will Boris Johnson, Joe Biden, AOC and their lot learn from reality?

Unreliability Makes Solar Power Impossibly Expensive,David Wojick,"Many states and the utilities they regulate are talking about replacing their coal and gas fired generators with solar and wind power. For example, I recently wrote about how the crazy-named Virginia Clean Economy Act already has almost 800 square miles of solar slabs in the developmental lineup. See https://www.cfact.org/2021/12/27/paving-virginia-with-solar-slabs-is-a-bad-law/.

Given the high intermittency of wind and solar the idea of running on solar and wind turns out to be an extremely costly prospect. It is all about reliability. Electricity must be there when we need it. Below I present some simple calculations that show just how bad this idea really is.

Reliability analysis of large scale solar and wind power generation can be very complex. Both depend on the weather, which can vary dramatically and quickly. Both can depend heavily on other available power sources, if available. They can also depend on each other under some conditions.

Here we will simply analyze certain basic features of power generation, as a way to scale the issues. For a start we will simply consider what a stand alone 1,000 MW solar system with battery storage requires for reliability.

The 1,000 MW is power reliably delivered to the grid around the clock. Because of intermittency, considerably more than 1,000 MW of generating capacity will be required. A lot of battery storage will also be required. Thus the capital cost will be a lot more than simply the cost of 1,000 MW of generating capacity. We will discus these additional costs. Note that adding wind power does not reduce these very large costs.

Given this simple 1,000 MW analysis it will be relatively easy to then consider other possible systems of different size and with different features.

Reliability of 1,000 MW of round the clock solar generation

Solar is relatively simple because of the predictable daily cycle of night and day. Generating times do differ depending on the time of year. They also vary depending on how moveable the panels are, that is to what degree they can track the sun’s daily movement across the sky.

The full sun case

For simplicity let us first assume 8 hours of full sun and full power every day. Clearly we need 16 hours of storage every night. That is 16,000 MWh of battery storage. We also need another 2,000 MW of generating capacity to charge the batteries every day.

So the full sun requirements are 3,000 MW of solar generating capacity and 16,000 MWh of storage capacity, in order to reliable generate 1,000 MW around the clock.

The dark cloudy days case

Solar generating capacity can be drastically reduced on dark cloudy days. When very cloudy the output can be reduced to just 10% of nameplate capacity. Dark cloudiness can last for days, thus requiring more battery backup along with the generating capacity to charge these dark days batteries.

How many successive days of dark cloudiness to design for is a complex question of local and regional meteorology. Here we simply use 5 days but it easily could be more. Five dark days certainly happens from time to time in most states. In Virginia’s case it can happen over the whole Mid-Atlantic region, so no one has significant solar power. This rules out buying solar power from the neighbors.

Reliability requires designing for these relatively extreme events. With conventional generation you design for maximum need for power but with wind and solar you also have to design for minimum supply. That minimum case is what I am looking at here.

The required battery capacity is simple. Five days at 24 hours a day is 120 hours. To supply a steady 1,000 MW that is a whopping 120,000 MWh of storage. We already have the overnight storage capacity for 16 hours so we now need an additional 104 hours, which means 104,000 MWh of additional storage.

However, the required additional generating capacity to charge these dark days batteries is far from simple. It all depends on how long we have to do the charging. The more time we have the smaller the required generating capacity.

It is vital to get the dark days batteries charged before the next dark days arrive, which in some cases might be very soon. This too is a matter of meteorology. To be conservative we here first assume that we have two bright sunny days to do the job.

Two days gives us 16 hours of charging time for the needed 120,000 MWh, which requires a large 7,500 MW of generating capacity. We already have 3,000 MW of generating capacity but that is in use providing round the clock sunny day power. It is not available to help recharge the dark days batteries. Turns out we need a whopping 10,500 MW of solar generating capacity.

This 10,500 MW is a lot considering we only want to reliably generate 1,000 MW around the clock. Moreover, some of this additional generating capacity will seldom be used. But reliability is like that due to the great variability of weather. In conventional fossil fueled generation the extreme event that drives design is peak need (also called peak demand). Special generators called “peakers” are used for this case. In the solar case the special equipment is batteries or other forms of storage.

Note that if we have 5 days to recharge the dark days batteries then the amount of required generation is a lot less. Five days gives us 40 hours to charge the 120,000 MWh so one only needs 3,000 MW of additional generating capacity, added to the 3,000 MW we need to produce daily power on sunny days.

At this point we need 120,000 MWh of battery storage and from 6,000 to 10,500 MW of generating capacity, in order to reliable supply 1,000 MW of round the clock power.

These large numbers occur because following a period of dark cloudy days we are doing three things simultaneously during the daylight generating hours. We are (1) generating 1,000 MW of immediately used electricity, while recharging both the (2) nighttime batteries and the (3) dark days batteries.

Note too that the numbers should actually be bigger. Batteries are not charged 100% and then drained to zero. The standard practice is to operate between 80% and 20%. In that case the available storage is just 60% of the nameplate capacity. This turns the dark days 120,000 MWh into a requirement for 200,000 MWh.

The cost of the dark days case

A standard figure from EIA for the cost of grid scale battery arrays is $250 per kWh, which gives $250,000 per MWh. At this cost the required 200,000 MWh of storage for around the clock 1,000 MW is $50 billion.

A standard EIA figure for PV solar capacity is $1300 per kW or $1,300,000 per MW. This makes the 6,000 to 10,500 MW cost $7.8 to 13.7 billion.

This makes $60 billion for just 1,000 MW a good rough estimate for stand alone solar capacity to meet the 5 dark cloudy days case. (As explained below, adding wind power does not reduce this number because the 5 dark days may also see zero wind output.)

The partly cloudy case

The partly cloudy days case is far more complex. Much of the time this loss of solar generation might be handled with the dark days batteries. But this may not be the case if the dark days event is either preceded or followed by partly cloudy days, especially if these are relatively dark. Note that partly cloudy here includes complete cloudiness where the cloud cover is light enough to still enable significantly more than the 10% generation under the dark days case.

Given these complexities the partly cloudy case is beyond the scope of this simple analysis. It is very likely that this case will require additional battery storage and generating capacity. How much is hard to say.

Note too that several costly features are not included. One example is transmission to get solar power from point of origin to load centers, which may be distant. Another is a reserve generating capacity or margin of safety, which might be as high as 20%. One cannot assume everything will work perfectly when the system is stressed. This is especially true if the dark days include widespread heavy snowfall, which can greatly delay recharging.

Reliability of round the clock wind generation to back up solar

Wind generation does not share the predictable daily cycle that solar enjoys so it is more complex from the beginning. With solar we can count on relatively good ongoing generation on most days. Wind power can drop to nothing frequently during a day, as well as delivering nothing for several days in a row and very little for long periods of time in many locations.

It is not a matter of no wind, just low wind. Wind generators require sustained winds of considerable velocity in order begin to generate substantial amounts of power. In many parts of the country stagnant, multi-day high pressure systems cause both low wind and a heavy need for electricity.

It is very important to note that because of this great variability wind power cannot be used to reduce the massive requirements of the dark days solar case. This is because it is always possible that there will be no wind power during the dark days, as well as during the recharge time after this extreme event. A stand alone solar and wind system has to be designed to handle this extreme, but common, possibility.

Solar and wind power cannot replace coal and gas at a reasonable cost. Intermittency makes solar and wind power impossibly expensive. This is likely true in all states and certainly in Virginia.

EV’s Destined to Pay for Upgrading Electrical Grids,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","California has always advertised itself as being the “leader”, but the UK has gone one-up on California with their creative EV charging regulations. Turns out that EV charging may be another source of revenue for the UK:

UK regulations coming into force in June 2022, will restrict charging times, as new chargers in the home and workplace are to automatically switch off in peak times to avoid potential blackouts.

New UK chargers will be pre-set to not function during 9-hours of peak loads, from 8am to 11am (3-hours), and 4pm to 10pm (6-hours). In addition, all home installed UK electric vehicle chargers will be required to be separately metered and send this information to a Smart meter data communications network. Potentially, this UK legislation allows the electricity used for charging EVs to be charged and taxed at a higher rate than domestic electricity.

The UK technology enacted also enables the rationing of electricity for EV charging because the UK government can decide when and if an EV can be charged, plus allowing the EV battery to be drained into the UK grid if required.

The UK’s charging legislation going into effect June 2022, may be a prelude for new American charging legislation to protect the grid and become a source for greater rate revenue generation from those that can afford EVs.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the global electric vehicle fleet expanded significantly over the last decade, underpinned by supportive policies and technology advances to boost the stock to 7.2 million electric cars. Today however, there are 1.2 billion vehicles on the world’s roads with projections of 2 billion by 2035. Obviously, more EV’s are coming on to be charged from unstable electrical grids.

Before you commit to an EV, calculate your total annual cost for fuel for your present vehicle. With electricity prices on the rise, and the potential for the electricity for EV charging to be even higher than domestic rates, there may be a shock (again, no pun intended) about potential savings to join the EV revolution.

Toyota recently warned the world that the world is far from ready to jettison gasoline and diesel engines and require batteries to run our replacements. Toyota is one of the world’s two largest auto and truck manufacturers — twice the size of General Motors (GM), our biggest. When Toyota speaks, car buyers listen. Hopefully, our elected officials will as well.

Robert Wimmer, Toyota’s head of energy and environmental research, testified in 2021 before the U.S. Senate warning of electricity supply problems.

Wimmer’s remarks came on the heels of GM’s announcement that it will phase out all gas internal combustion engines by 2035. Other manufacturers, including Mini, have followed suit with similar announcements that may be leading to a consumer disaster. To meet the emission regulations being imposed on the automobile manufacturing sector they are being “regulated” toward zero emission vehicles.

For Toyota, it is not just about finding enough critical EV battery material such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. It’s also about:

having enough electricity in the power grid to recharge EV batteries.

the anti-humanism of climate radicalism associated with the exotic minerals and metals that is discussed at length in the Pulitzer Prize nominated book “Clean Energy Exploitations – Helping Citizens Understand the Environmental and Humanity Abuses That Support Clean Energy,”.

the wealthier and healthier countries like Germany, Australia, Britain, and America that continue to exploit the most vulnerable people in the world with yellow, brown, and black skin, and environments of the world today for them to go “green”.

Today, most states have an adequate electricity supply, but if proposals banning natural gas in new homes and buildings, and demands for EV recharging skyrocket, states could face the same brownouts as California and China.

China currently has the most EVs on the road while California leads the U.S. with about half of all EVs in America being in the temperate climate of California. China and California, which have large wind and solar farms, have grid overload and increasingly, people are losing electricity. It is likely to be far worse in the future.

Toyota’s alarm is a good thing. Addressing the electricity shortfalls now, before our backs are against the wall, is even better. But the UK idea of charging (pardon the pun) EV owners more for the electricity to charge their EV batteries, may be another nail in the coffin for the publics’ acceptance of an affordable EV future.

Add in that several EV automobile manufacturers have issued safety warnings about it being unsafe to park underground due to potential EV battery fires, and to not charge unattended, may make EV ownership a very bad deal.

Increasing electricity rates, and possibly higher rates just for EV charging may be an important civil rights issue that especially disadvantaged minorities (Blacks and Hispanics) should be watching.

Being a Climate Alarmist Means Never Having to Admit You’re Wrong,H. Sterling Burnett,"A mountain of evidence shows climate alarmists never learn from their mistakes, be they clear misstatements of facts or repeatedly failed prognostications.

Why should they? The press lets climate alarmists get away with making more false claims than any other group on any other topic, including the efficacy of the COVID vaccines in keeping people from catching the disease or requiring hospitalization. Climate alarmists have nothing to fear from so-called fact checkers in corporate or social media, because the “fact checkers” are either true believers themselves or fellow beneficiaries of the climate alarm gravy train.

Accordingly, I have decided to of expose a litany of climate false alarm claims made in recent months periodically in my lead essay of Climate Change Weekly. These essays won’t be about politics or opinions but instead straight exposés of patently false climate science assertions publicized in the preceding months, for which the authors of those stories were never called to the carpet or forced to issue a correction.

In Climate Change Weekly last July, I poked fun at one of the most mystifyingly wrong but persistent claims made by climate alarmists: that a warmer world would mean the disappearance of snow. This claim is definitively refuted by data cited in Climate at a Glance: Snowpack showing average North American snowpack extent is virtually unchanged in recent years compared to the late 1960s, when satellite measurements began. Beyond America, average snowpack has increased throughout the Northern Hemisphere in the fall and winter months, but you’d never know this if you read the headlines of major newspapers or watch climate-related news stories on corporate media outlets.

For example, in December even as huge storm fronts were striking the Western mountain ranges from California through Washington State, the Washington Post published an article titled “Snow may vanish for years at a time in Mountain West with climate warming.” Not to be outdone in the snow stupidity competition, just last week The New York Times published an article asserting “Skiing is an endangered sport, caught between a warming planet and a global pandemic.” The article states, “In recent years, with snow cover diminishing and untouched powder increasingly difficult to reach, skiers like Ms. Backstrom have been pushed onto groomed trails more often.”

In two Climate Realism articles, Heartland Institute President James Taylor went to the data and resoundingly refuted other false and wrongheaded claims made by the Times and the Post. Citing satellite measurements gathered by the Rutgers University Global Snow Lab (GSL) on global, hemispheric, and continental snow cover dating back to the 1960s, Taylor showed the past 30 years have brought no decline in global or North American snow cover. Instead, there has been a modest increase in snow cover during the past three decades. Taylor writes,

The Times‘ article is particularly ironic considering the many snowfall records that have been set in prime ski regions during the past year. North Lake Tahoe, which is home to several of the best ski slopes in the country, enjoyed a record 18 feet of snow last month. Yosemite National Park set a snowfall record, also, last month. Even further south, Mammoth, California set snowfall records as recently as May, 2019.

Indeed, in the beginning of January, data showed snowpack in Oregon’s portion of the Cascades was 126 percent above normal for this time of year. In late December, Newsweek reported snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains was between 145 and 161 percent of the normal amount of snow for this time of year.

Despite former Vice-President Al Gore claiming in his 2006 docuganda An Inconvenient Truth that “within the decade there will be no more snows of Kilimanjaro,” the mountain has had snow cover every single day since Gore made his movie. So much snow fell in 2018 there were record increases in snow depth on the mountain, and in mid-December 2021, which is summer in Tanzania, where Kilimanjaro is located, the mountain received seven straight days of snow, with the temperatures each day hovering around 10 degrees below zero.

Sometimes the reporting on climate is simply idiotic. For instance, in a recent story, the Washington Post displayed a map of the United States purportedly showing every county in the country hit by a climate-related disaster in 2021. Among the eye-opening disasters the Post claimed were caused by climate change was one the public may have missed: the hurricane that hit upstate Vermont and Buffalo, New York. Oh wait, you didn’t miss it: as the people living there and the weatherpersons for the area can attest, no hurricane struck either location.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirms no hurricanes or even tropical storms hit or even approached either region in 2021.

With no apparent sense of irony or self-awareness, alarmists regularly cite highly localized weather effects as proof of a climate emergency. In late October, within the space of 24 hours, news reports highlighted both that Lake Tahoe had fallen below its natural rim, threatening water flows to the Truckee River and the Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, and that in response to rain and snowfall in the region the lake had risen above its rim once again, resuming water flows. This climate whiplash showed the reporters and editors either didn’t understand or don’t care about the difference between climate and weather. Both reports also ignored the significant population growth in the region exploiting Lake Tahoe, which makes increasing demands on that body of water.

Drought in the region surrounding Lake Tahoe is not unusual, nor are wildly fluctuating water levels in the lake. My colleague, award-winning meteorologist Anthony Watts, pointed out in Climate at a Glance: Water Levels—Lake Tahoe as recently as 2019, water levels in the lake were regularly exceeding its maximum allowable levels, forcing the agency charged with managing the dam on Lake Tahoe to release water from it. Lake Tahoe reached the maximum allowable water level each year from 2017 through 2019, requiring special water releases into the Truckee River.

As the climate alarmists’ apparent desperation increases, their warnings become shriller and less believable, yet hardly a day goes by without some media outlet parroting their false assertions, such as that Michigan is becoming so hot farmers will soon be unable to grow fruit there (tell that to farmers in Florida or Texas) and global warming is producing late-season frost events and freezes.

Folks, I can’t make this stuff up. My imagination just isn’t that good. Michigan too hot to grow fruit, really! Unrecorded hurricanes in western New York and Vermont! Warmer growing seasons plagued by more freezing nights, as a result of global warming! It is all too fantastic, yet the news media daily swallow such fairy tales hook, line, and sinker and publicize them, giving them undeserved credence.

Sadly, this is what passes for journalism these days. Keep that in mind when you read the next headline claiming some extreme weather event or anomalous occurrence is becoming the norm because of climate change, and check Climate Realism, Climate at a Glance, and other outlets devoted to presenting the facts on climate change before you start stocking up on food or building a bunker in the mountains far from the supposedly fast-rising seas.

HIGHER CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS DON’T THREATEN HUMAN HEALTH … HOLLAND SHOWS HANDLING RISING SEAS IS A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE, NOT AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT

HIGHER CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS DON’T THREATEN HUMAN HEALTH

Recent research confirms indoor carbon dioxide levels are much higher than any reasonably expected atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, yet they pose no threat to human health.

“Every year there are several papers published attempting to establish CO2 as a pollutant in indoor settings,” writes Kenneth Richard at No Tricks Zone. “This has likely served to scare people to regard elevated CO2 levels as dangerous—which is almost certainly the intent.”

Research definitively refutes any claims indoor carbon dioxide harms human health.

Research from 2002 found schoolkids in 120 randomly selected classrooms across two school districts in Texas experienced no ill health when peak carbon dioxide concentrations exceeded 1,000 parts per million (ppm) in 88 percent of the classrooms and 3,000 ppm in 21 percent of the classrooms.

Two articles from 2021 confirm much higher carbon dioxide levels do not harm peoples’ health, impose measurable negative physiological changes, or decrease cognitive functioning.

The first study, published by InderScience, a global academic publisher based in Geneva, notes even at the most extreme projections, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are not expected to exceed 690 ppm by the end of 2100. In this study, Alberto Boretti, Ph.D., dean of research at Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, found people showed no reduction of cognitive abilities at indoor CO2 concentrations exceeding 1,000 ppm. Boretti writes,

It has been claimed that the dangerous rise in atmospheric CO2 levels will impede our brain functions, and namely that the continued fossil fuel emissions will impair cognition. … It is shown as even continuing at the present rate the atmospheric CO2 concentration is not expected to exceed 690 p.p.m. by 2100. Since no significant effects on cognitive performance are seen also for indoor CO2 levels much higher than 1,000 p.p.m., opening the window of crowded spaces could be a simple but effective mitigation strategy better than building up wind and solar capacity.

The second study from 2021, published in the peer-reviewed journal Indoor Air, examined the effect of greatly elevated indoor carbon dioxide levels on a broad array of health indicators such as blood chemistry, heart rate, respiratory rate, flexibility, and long-term and short-term measurements of cognitive ability. The results speak for themselves:

Blood pH decreased and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) increased significantly when exposed to 20,000 ppm [emphasis mine] CO2 compared to 770 ppm. However, the values remained within the normal range. In addition, respiratory rate increased slightly but significantly at 20,000 ppm CO2. No significant changes in heart rate, CFF, task performance or acute health were found. In sum, the findings suggest that the observed changes in acid-base balance and ventilation can be classified as physiological adaptation responses. Impairment of cognitive performance is not expected from exposure to 20,000 ppm CO2, neither as direct effect on central nervous system function nor as a distraction related to perception of health effects.

If much-higher CO2 levels have no measureable harmful effect on human health and are not worsening weather extremes, as is demonstrated amply at Climate at a Glance, I’m left wondering what climate crisis the world faces. What’s all the fuss about?

HOLLAND SHOWS HANDLING RISING SEAS IS A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE, NOT AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT

An article in the publication Human Progress demonstrates Holland’s long experience in dealing with rising seas and populations living at or below sea level shows any threatened increase in sea levels due to climate change poses at most technical challenges, certainly not an existential threat to continued human existence (even on the coasts, much less inland).

Author Joakim Book notes the Dutch, “trapped between some of Europe’s largest rivers and the violent North Sea waves,” have been battling rising seas for the entirety of the country’s existence, and they have consistently won the war, reclaiming land and building cities and ports even as seas continued rising:

Holland is a flat, low-lying country on the edge of a stormy sea. To make matters worse, between 20 and 40 percent of its land area is at, or below, sea level. Yet, as the Dutch have shown for centuries, it is possible to live below the water level with appropriate water management and technology. The water level on Dutch shores has increased steadily for over 3,000 years (and even more rapidly for 7,000 years before that). In other words, long before the Industrial Revolution, modern capitalism, or the burning of fossil fuels, the Dutch had to adapt—a strategy reviled by purist climate change activists.

Despite the challenge of ever-rising seas, the Dutch have thrived to the extent of playing “an outsized role in the history of the world—in foreign trade, economic growth, and financial development,” Book writes. “Their tolerant ethics may have kicked off the Great Enrichment, thus producing the world’s first modern economy. The Dutch also invented central banking and perfected the art of public debt and securities markets. Most impressively, they accomplished all that while under constant siege from the ocean.”

The people of Holland have even exacerbated the problem of encroaching seas by draining swamps and reclaiming land for agriculture, which has resulted in rapid land subsidence. Land in the Netherlands was sinking by up to two centimeters per year in the late Middle Ages, five times the rate sea levels are currently rising around the world and more than double the rate projected in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s worst-case scenario through 2100. Still the Dutch thrived.

The Netherlands is a relatively wealthy, technologically sophisticated country. Should climate change contribute to rising seas in the future, the best evidence is that Holland can handle it, and doing so would be less expensive and disruptive than eschewing fossil fuel use or attempting to “reverse centuries of carbon emissions.”

What’s true for the Netherlands is equally true for the rest of us.

“Fortifying our societies against the climate is a constant challenge,” concludes Book. “But like the Dutch war against the waves, fortification against nature’s whims is a technical problem that requires engineering and adaptation, not fearmongering.”

The best evidence suggests he is right.

Environmentalism Has Lost its Way,David Wojick,"Driven by climate madness, the environmental movement has become the greatest advocate of destructive industrial development in history.

As Kant said: “To will the end is to will the means”. In this case the means to the phantom end of climate control have led environmentalists to abandon all of their principles. Solar and wind require environmental destruction on an unprecedented scale. Electrification requires the use of toxic chemicals on a similar scale. The hazardous waste stream is enormous.

Solar is the worst because the destruction of forests and open land is complete. Perhaps something lives under these vast solar slabs but not much and certainly nothing like what they destroy and displace.

As I pointed out in my recent article on Virginia’s ill-named Clean Economy Act, we are talking about hundreds of square miles of solar devastation today, for just one state. See my https://www.cfact.org/2021/12/27/paving-virginia-with-solar-slabs-is-a-bad-law/.

To actually meet our need for electricity would require several thousand square miles of destruction just for Virginia. For the whole country the numbers are staggering, easily the biggest environmental disaster in our history.

Wind is environmentally destructive too, just in a different way.

Let me make this personal. I live in the mountains, in far eastern West Virginia. When I drive to the county seat I get a grand view of the big mountain to the west. It is called the Allegheny Front, the height of land between the Atlantic and Mississippi watersheds. My magnificent natural view is now being industrialized, dotted with windmills and more on the way.

I am sure natural vistas are everywhere threatened, because that is where the best wind is. Mind you we almost never get sustained winds strong enough for full power, but that just means they need more intrusive industrial wind machines to produce the juice.

Even worse, there is a viewpoint up on the Front called Bear Rocks, where crowds gather every fall to watch the hawk migration. Great numbers of hawks come by in swirling groups called kettles, working their way slowly southward down the Front. Surely significant numbers will be killed by the growing phalanx of giant chopping blades.

West Texas has something like 10,000 choppers and other states are rapidly going the same way. That the environmentalists can allow the killing of enormous numbers of protected birds is a clear abandonment of their principles. This is Silent Spring in real life, with entire species threatened.

Then too, environmentalists fight hard for roadless areas. Scattering giant wind machines around a mountain top requires a dense system of access roads, one to every tower. In rugged terrain these systems can be complex and so big, destructive land users.

At the other end of the wire we have chemicals, especially enormous numbers of big batteries.

First come the huge battery arrays needed to turn highly intermittent wind and solar power into reliable juice. Then come the myriad batteries needed to electrify our transportation system, which also requires a lot more solar and wind devastation. Note that a lot of juice will go through batteries twice on its way to use.

Minimizing the use of toxic chemicals has been a cornerstone environmental principle. That the movement should now opt for chemical energy as a central feature of our energy system is a complete abandonment of that principle.

Then there is solid waste, which has always been a central environmental concern. Compared to conventional power plants, wind blades and solar panels are short lived, batteries are ridiculously so. In a solar, wind and battery world we are likely talking about billions of tons of toxic waste.

I think just about every principle of environmentalism is violated by the proposed massive buildout of wind, solar and electrification. Why the environmentalists are not screaming and suing to stop this vast open land destroying, wildlife killing and chemically intensive action is beyond me. Clearly environmentalism has lost its way.

Imagine Electric Vehicles in Bad Weather,"Ronald Stein, P.E.","With more than forty percent of the EV’s in America being in California at the end of 2020, the EV popularity in California has gotten President Biden so excited to want the rest of the country to follow California’s lead that Biden issued a new executive order that pushes for half of all new cars sold in America by 2030 to be electric vehicles.

Imagine being stuck on a frigid night inside your car, like those stopped on Interstate 95 in Virginia in a 48-mile backup for nearly a 24-hour standstill because of snow. Imagine being trapped in an frozen electric car with a long dead battery!

Even with the great California year-round weather, the states’ EV user’s experiences do not bode well for projected EV sales in America as the states’ EV users may be sending a caution-to-the-wind (no pun intended) message to America that the EV usage in the state reflects very conservative notices to future EV owners. A few reasons why Californians may be sending the wrong message to America are:

The limited usage of the EV’s of about 5,000 miles per year is a reflection that the EV is a second vehicle, for those that can afford them, and not the family workhorse vehicle. The primary owners of EV’s are the highly educated and financially well off, and not representative of the majority. EV owner incomes rank among the highest in the country which may be a reflection of home owners that have easier access to charging their EV from their multi-car garages, or for those folks living in new apartments that may have access to more convenient EV charging capabilities. Most car owners park in the street. According to ValuePenguin insurance, because electric vehicles cost more outright and are more expensive to repair, the average car insurance for an electric vehicle is about 23 percent more expensive than the cost for the equivalent combustion model. The ethnicity of Tesla owner’s skews toward Caucasians, at 87 percent. Owners who identify with Hispanic ethnicity make up 8 percent of Tesla owners, leaving 5 percent to other ethnicities. From that limited elite ownership group, there is a growing percentage of those California EV users that are switching back to gasoline cars, which is sending a message that may further deflate EV growth projections.

EVs are still a luxury product that attract the Benz and Beemer crowd, not low- and middle-income consumers. The average household income for EV buyers is about $140,000. That’s roughly nearly twice the US median, which is about $63,000.

Here are a few examples of inclement weather conditions, that will most likely never occur in the idyllic year-round weather of sunny California’s EV “capital” of America:

Imagine Florida with a hurricane coming toward Miami. The Governor orders an evacuation. All cars head north. They all need to be charged in Jacksonville. How does that work? If all cars were electric, and were caught up in a three-hour traffic jam with dead batteries, then what? Not to mention that there is virtually no heating or air conditioning in an electric vehicle because of high battery consumption.

If you get stuck on the road all night, no battery, no heating, no windshield wipers, no radio, no GPS (all these drain the batteries), all you can do is try calling 911 to take women and children to safety. But they cannot come to help you because all roads are blocked, and they will probably require all police cars will be electric also. When the roads become unblocked no one can move! Their batteries are dead.

How do you charge thousands of cars in the traffic jam? Same problem during summer vacation departures with miles of traffic jams. There would be virtually no air conditioning in an electric vehicle. It would drain the batteries quickly. Where is this electricity going to come from? Today’s grid barely handles users’ needs.

Frigid driving conditions: Did you know that 17 percent of car crashes in the United States happen in winter conditions? EV batteries must work harder in the cold, which is why they drain quickly in extreme temperatures. Low temperatures, such as 40 degrees or below, can decrease the driving range for EVs by 40 percent.

As Pew Research reported in June, “In each of the past three years, EVs accounted for about 2% of the U.S. new-car market.” The reasons why EVs aren’t grabbing consumers by the tailpipe are many, but the main ones are affordability, charging and range functionality, and the possible exposure to inclement weather.

Another challenge for the EV growth is the EV charging dependence on intermittent electricity generated from breezes and sunshine. Adding EV charging loads onto the grid that is becoming more unstable is like putting salt in the wound. Power outages are now commonplace in California and Texas with more to follow throughout the nation as we adjust to a life dependent upon the time of day and the weather.

Amid tougher emissions regulations worldwide, established automakers are racing to add more EVs to their lineup, but until the current elite owners can demonstrate to the middle-income and those on fixed incomes that their EV’s are their primary family workhorse vehicles, the less fortunate will most likely remain reluctant to buy into the EV evolution.

Growing the supply chain for EV’s without a corresponding growth in demand, could be an economic disaster in the works.

Australia’s Giant Green Gamble on Solar Energy Toys,,"By the time solar energy reaches Earth’s surface it is spread very thin – even midday sunshine will not boil the billy or make toast. And solar collectors will only convert about 20% of that weak energy into electricity. Thus thousands of solar panels are needed to collect significant energy, and lots more to charge the expensive batteries needed to maintain electricity supply overnight and during cloudy weather. Despite these disadvantages, force-feeding of “green” energy by all levels of government has given Australia nearly three million solar collectors (mainly imported from China).

It requires scads of land to generate significant electricity from the sun’s weak rays. But even in sunny weather they produce nothing for 16 hours every day. And a sprinkling of dust, pollen, ash or salt, or a few splatters of poop from birds or flying foxes can reduce output by 50%, while night, snow or heavy cloud cover snuffs them out completely.

Solar energy collection is maximised if the panels face the sun exactly and follow the daily and seasonal movements of the sun across the sky. No rooftop collectors and only 40% of ground facilities can do this. Thus to produce the planned energy requires an even bigger area of collector panels, covering even more land.

More interested in propaganda than science, greens call land-based arrays “solar farms” suggesting they are plant-friendly places. However solar panels steal sunlight, leaving real plants beneath them to die. Solar “farms” have nothing in common with real farms except the need for large areas of open countryside – usually consuming valuable flattish cleared farmland or open grassland.

In fact growing plants are a liability to solar “farms” because they can block solar energy, so the operators must prevent grass, weeds and bushes from shadowing the panels and stealing their sunshine. Thus most plant-life in solar “farms” is killed – either by the blocking of the sun, or by regular applications of herbicide, or by roadways.

A big solar “farm” in Australia could contain one million solar panels and smother 2,000 acres of land. Each operation also needs miles of cleared access roads and transmission lines to maintain the facility, collect the electricity and transmit it to urban demand centres. Most of the time these transmission lines are operating well below capacity, creating an expensive web of inefficient maintenance liabilities.

Australia is also a world leader in installing subsidised rooftop solar. But a quick drive around the suburbs will show that few panels have the size, the ideal orientation or the cleanliness to be efficient collectors of solar energy – they are green status symbols designed to collect subsidies. Many will fail to recover the real cost of manufacture, transport, installation and restoration. They destabilise the electricity network and elevate average electricity prices for industry and for those who cannot afford a house, let alone one with its own solar panels.

All for ZERO climate benefits.

The picture below illustrates what is wrong with rooftop solar.

https://saltbushclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rooftop-solar.jpg

Random Panel Orientation, plus a Cloudy Sky = Negligible Solar Electricity

Picture credit: www.powerhomesolar.com

Intermittent “green” energy forces coal and gas plants to operate at full capacity to cover peak demands around sunrise and sunset, but to wind back or shut down when solar energy pours into the system around midday. Recently in just one week in South Australia (Australia’s green energy guinea pig), electricity generation went from “over 130% renewables to less than 4%, renewables with everything in between”. Despite South Australia being home to “the biggest battery in the world”, the energy regulator has been forced to lease diesel back-up generators and to order gas-fired plants to stand by in case the wind suddenly drops – this encourages mechanical and financial breakdowns, and high electricity costs.

Europe has also gone out onto the green energy limb, but this is no comfort for Australians who cannot import nuclear power from France, gas from Russia or hydro-power from Scandinavia.

Every solar installation consumes energy to mine metals, manufacture, transport and erect panels and to build access roads and transmission lines over long distances. Careful analysis will show an energy deficit over their short lifetimes. And when an earthquake, hailstorm, cyclone or hurricane smashes these exposed rows of solar panels, rubbish dumps of mangled trash will be left. Most of this debris cannot be recycled and tonnes of metals, glass and plastic are destined to end their life as toxic, non-degradable land fill.

Bureaucrats will try to force solar operators to clean up, but smart operators will have bankruptcy petitions prepared for such emergencies.

Here’s a solar “farm” after a cyclone or typhoon:

Proven and reliable electricity generators, driven by coal, gas, hydro or nuclear, with a small land footprint and housed in storm-proof structures, are far less damaging to the green environment than these landscapes of inefficient, intermittent, expensive plant-killing “farms”.

Where are the Green objectors now?

"Alarmists Embrace Authoritarianism, Ignore Lessons of History",H. Sterling Burnett,"A rump group of the environmental movement has always been wedded to authoritarianism—primarily the movement’s intellectual leadership. Going back to the beginnings of environmentalism as a movement, Progressive-era politicians such as President Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot (Roosevelt’s friend and choice to be the first head of the newly created U.S. Forest Service) believed democracy and markets were both ill-suited to manage natural resources. Progressives believed natural resources should be controlled, developed, and conserved by elite scientific managers, bureaucrats unbeholden to the wishes of the public.

Later, as detailed by Alston Chase in his powerful book In a Dark Wood, many Nazis were at least in part inspired by an expansive vision of environmental purity.

Although few if any progressives were full-on misanthropes, there have always some of these within the environmental movement, pushing for increasingly extreme actions in defense of the environment and against human use of natural resources. The misanthropic wing of the movement has referred to humans as “a cancer,” “a disease,” and “a parasite,” with some openly hoping for a killer virus to come along and wipe out most of humanity. Eco-philosopher Arne Naess, who coined the term deep ecology, said the ideal human population on Earth is 200 million, and he called for policies and personal actions to achieve that goal as soon as possible. Others have estimated the “optimal” human population as 1.5 to 2 billion people and claimed this justifies population engineering, including both “active” and “passive” means to get there.

Although authoritarians among the climate alarm crowd are not all misanthropes, all misanthropic climate scolds support authoritarian measures to prevent climate change.

Now even the academic literature is increasingly embracing authoritarianism as the world’s allegedly last best hope to avert supposedly apocalyptic climate change. A book released by leading academic publisher Routledge in late 2019 (missed by many because of the pandemic), Liberty and the Ecological Crisis: Freedom on a Finite Planet, says it is urgent for governments to take away people’s freedom:

This book examines the concept of liberty in relation to civilization’s ability to live within ecological limits. [I]t is our relatively unbounded freedom that has resulted in so much ecological devastation. … The overarching framework for this collection is that liberty and agency need to be rethought…. On a finite planet, our choices will become limited if we hope to survive the climatic transitions set in motion by uncontrolled consumption of resources and energy over the past 150 years.

The American Political Science Review, a publication of Cambridge University Press, recently published an article, “Political Legitimacy, Authoritarianism, and Climate Change,” which begins by asking, “Is authoritarian power ever legitimate?” The author, Ross Mittiga, answers with a resounding “Yes!” Pointing to the restrictions many governments established in response to COVID-19 as the type of emergency justifying authoritarian limits on freedom, the author states, “Climate change poses an even graver threat to public safety. Consequently, I argue, legitimacy may require a similarly authoritarian approach.”

It should be noted that some governments resisted the authoritarian urge. South Dakota in the United States and Sweden in Europe, for example, did not impose authoritarian lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their populations’ health fared better than those in many places where governments imposed draconian restrictions on personal freedom, movement, public and even private gatherings, and work, under emergency powers. Based on the ongoing nature of the pandemic and the rise of multiple virus variants, there is limited evidence the authoritarian emergency restrictions imposed by most governments did anything to contain, much less end, the virus.

“The restrictions just weren’t stringent enough or imposed for a long enough time,” I can almost hear some climate alarmists saying.

What we can say with some confidence is that democracy suffered under the COVID response, with Freedom House reporting democracy grew weaker in 80 countries, among them the United States, during the pandemic. Abuse of power by governments and mistrust of government both grew during the pandemic, Freedom House reports.

Mittiga says climate change is a greater threat than COVID and therefore justifies long-term restrictions on life choices even stricter than those imposed over the past two years. How the public will respond to that might best be judged by the visible street protests to ongoing or newly reimposed restrictions in Europe and elsewhere, and the people widely flouting mask mandates, fighting vaccine mandates, and publicly sharing information about adverse vaccine reactions and COVID cases among the fully vaccinated in the United States. This type of pushback presents a problem for Mittiga unless the type of authoritarian solutions he supports are much more like those of North Korea, Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, China under Mao, and Russia under Stalin than what the liberal democracies have dared attempt thus far.

This authoritarian turn does not surprise me. I wrote about it in the past, most recently in Climate Change Weekly 411 and Climate Change Weekly 406. In the latter I wrote this:

[T]he energy cuts and lifestyle changes required to hit net zero will mean going back to early-1800s levels of emissions. This will force enormously negative economic growth and giving up modern conveniences (and the freedoms they have created) that people in developed countries have come to take for granted over the past century. For people in developing countries the news is even worse. They will have to be kept from developing, which will consign even more generations to premature deaths and abject penury due to energy poverty and food privation. Oh well, climate alarmists whisper (usually in secret), you’ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.

Based on the evidence, I believe that no climate crisis is in the offing, that science shows the modest warming of the past century and any reasonably expected warming in the coming century has not caused calamity or even worsening weather extremes and is unlikely to do so. But even if I’m wrong, authoritarianism is the worst possible response to the climate crisis.

Climate alarmists praise China, ignoring the fact that it produces more greenhouse gases than every other industrialized economy on Earth combined and its emissions are growing. Also, as I detailed in a 1997 article titled “Five Eco-Despoiled Nations” in The World & I magazine, the countries with the worst environmental problems in the twentieth century were, with just one exception, communist or socialist dictatorships. (The exception was an impoverished, largely failed state with a history of careening back and forth between deeply disputed democratic elections and coups leading to authoritarian rule.)

Time and again, one finds the environment fares better in liberal democracies with largely market economies than in countries under authoritarian rule. This is not a coincidence.

Climate alarmists ignore this clear fact and display ignorance of history (and no understanding of human nature and how institutions shape behavior) in a second way: people like Mittiga, James Hansen, and others who embrace authoritarianism as a solution to the climate crisis somehow believe they will be the anointed ones wielding power if liberal democracies are displaced by authoritarian governments. I’m sure Robespierre and Trotsky felt the same, but history tells a very different story. See, for a contemporary example, China’s treatment of its environmental protesters and suppression of the environmental movement. Environmentalism doesn’t thrive under authoritarian rule. It is suppressed.

History shows revolutions resulting in dictatorships typically eat their children and those who they overthrew alike, indiscriminately and with equal fervor and self-perceived righteous indignation.

There is no good reason to believe climate alarmists who help bring down liberal democracies around the globe and replace them with authoritarian rule will enjoy a different fate.

On the contrary, statements made by those pushing the hardest for political action to fight climate change indicate they are in fact more interested in imposing socialism or authoritarianism, with them in control, than in protecting the environment or those most vulnerable to climate change. Many of my friends and colleagues refer to these wolves in sheep’s clothing as “watermelons”: green on the outside, Communist red on the inside. They are opportunists who use the specter of climate change to push their socialist political goals by indirect means. Many watermelons are longtime, deeply embedded, experienced political operatives, so there is good reason to believe they—not the academics, intellectuals, or true believers—will seize the reins of power if their revolution comes. The true believers, not the political schemers, would go to the wall along with the former regime.

Authoritarianism is bad, regardless of the cause it purportedly serves. Painting evil green does not make it better.

EUROPE’S WIND POWER STALLS … CARBON DIOXIDE HAS LESS WARMING EFFECT THAN ASSUMED

EUROPE’S WIND POWER STALLS

Europe faces ongoing energy shortages, and Reuters reports it is due to a predictable wind deficit.

Industrial wind power, and to a lesser extent solar, were supposed to be Europe’s solution to climate change, decarbonizing while keeping the lights on. It turns out they do not provide much of either.

Europe’s industrial wind complexes produced just 14 percent of their capacity from July through September 2021, down from the previous-low average of 20 to 26 percent of capacity. The result has been price spikes and power shortages as Europe has been forced to purchase more imported natural gas at inflated prices, largely from Russia, and to reopen shuttered coal-fueled power plants.

“If we had high winds or just reasonable winds over that period, we wouldn’t have seen these price spikes,” Rory McCarthy, a senior analyst at the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, told Reuters.

Europe has led the push for renewable electric power generation, and Germany has been at its vanguard. Germany’s wind energy production fell by 16 percent over the past year, because of poor wind conditions, even as its government has continued to push wind into an ever-larger share of the nation’s electric power portfolio.

The problem, as analysts have long known but governments have ignored, is that when renewable energy projects are mandated the governments tout “the total capacity, or maximum energy that could be produced from the wind farm on an annual basis,” as the Daily Caller notes. “Both wind and solar projects typically produce a small fraction of that capacity.”

As a result, energy consumers were hit with huge increases in the price of electric power as Russia cut gas exports to Europe while wind production declined.

Although some coal plants restarted, limiting the number of power failures, the price of power from restarted coal plants has also been rising because the operators have to purchase carbon dioxide credits in the European carbon-trading scheme. The increased demand and politically restricted supply have caused the price of these credits to soar, more than doubling since the start of 2021.

It’s an energy Catch-22 of Europe’s own making.

CARBON DIOXIDE HAS LESS WARMING EFFECT THAN ASSUMED

A recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal Climate, “Solar and Anthropogenic Influences on Climate: A Regression Analysis and Tentative Predictions,” concludes the influence of carbon dioxide on changes in global temperatures from 1860 until today was approximately half that asserted in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report.

This would imply the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to a doubling of carbon dioxide is more in line with simple climate models that project a modest rise of approximately 1℃ for a doubling of carbon dioxide. It also suggests two further things. First, the Earth’s climate is not as sensitive to increases of carbon dioxide as the climate models assume. Second, factors independent of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations have played a significant role in the recent rise of temperatures on the Earth over the past century and a half, just as we climate realists have been saying all along.

Physicist Frank Stefani, Ph.D., a researcher at the Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, a Dresden-based research laboratory that is a member of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres, examined the geomagnetic index, a measure of the Earth’s magnetic field as observed at Cambridge and Melbourne since 1844. Stefani conducted a regression analysis comparing changes in the index, carbon dioxide levels, and temperatures, concluding the ECS is approximately 1.1 +/- 0.5 °C. This is less than half of the ECS assumed in the climate models the IPCC relies on.

Stefani’s analysis indicates solar influence accounts for 30 to 70 percent of the recent planetary warming, in contrast to the IPCC which has claimed as much as 98 percent of the warming is human-induced. Because of the cyclical nature of solar activity, Stefani forecasts even a further increase in CO2 concentration of 2.5 ppm per year throughout the current century would produce only a 1° C temperature increase by the year 2100:

Even for the highest climate sensitivities, and an unabated linear CO2 increase, we predict only a mild additional temperature rise of around 1 K (Kelvin) until the end of the century, while for the lower values an imminent temperature drop in the near future, followed by a rather flat temperature curve, is prognosticated.

The 2°C target established in the 2015 Paris climate agreement “could likely be met even without any drastic decarbonization measures,” concludes Stefani.

The East Slams the West’s Climate ‘Colonialism’,,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s explosive comments are not surprising to anyone who has been closely observing the opposition of India and China to western pressure for adopting climate polices contrary to the two countries’ economic objectives.

“The colonial mindset hasn’t gone,” said Modi at a Constitution Day event. “We are seeing from developed nations that the path that made them developed is being closed for developing nations… If we talk about absolute cumulative (carbon) emissions, rich nations have emitted 15 times more from 1850 till now… The per capita emission is also 11 times more in the U.S. and the EU.”

Senior ministers in the past have called out the colonial nature of climate politics. However, this is the first that Modi has publicly recalled in this context, the colonialism of the 18th and 19th centuries when Western countries denied basic rights and autonomy to India and other colonies.

Carbon imperialism is no myth. The economic success of modern western society is a fruit of the industrial era driven by fossil fuels. Even in the 21st century, all the major developed economies rely on these fuels for primary energy needs. To deny the same growth for developing countries is hypocrisy tinged with the colonialism under which fates of billions were decided by leaders of the industrialized West.

“Attempts are made to shut the path and resources for developing nations through which developed nations reached where they are today,” said Modi. “In past decades, a web of different terminologies was spun for this. But the aim has always been one to stop the progress of developing nations. The issue of environment is also being attempted to be hijacked for this purpose. We saw an example of this in the recent COP26 Summit…. Today no nation exists as a colony to any other nation. (That) doesn’t mean that (the) colonial mindset ended… Still, India is lectured on environmental conservation.”

Modi also called out Indian activists, policy makers and organizations espousing an anti-fossil stance. Blaming them for hindering progress, he said, “Sadly, we also have such people in our country who stall the development of the nation in the name of freedom of expression without understanding the aspirations of the nation. Such people don’t bear the brunt, but those mothers who get no electricity for their children bear it.”

Modi is right. Hundreds of millions in India have no access to uninterrupted electricity. What people in the developed nations take for granted is still a luxury for millions here. Mothers do manual work for hours, children lack electricity to study for their exams, and industries lose millions of dollars in damaged equipment from unreliable power. Electricity disruption even impedes medical procedures in rural hospitals. Without reliable electricity, India cannot achieve fast-paced economic growth necessary for raising 300 million people out of poverty.

Meanwhile, Indians have some of the lowest levels of per capita carbon emissions. India’s per capita emission was measured at just 1.91 tons a year (2016) while that of the U.S. was 15.52 and Canada’s, 18.58.

Besides, there is no evidence that global CO2 emissions can cause catastrophic warming. Apocalyptic predictions are projections from computer models that have proven to be faulty. These models (used by U.N. climate alarmists and others) exaggerate warming by many times as they are designed to be ultra-sensitive to human CO2 emissions. So, there is no good reason for India to give in to climate pressure from the West.

It took a long time for the leader of 1.3 billion people to call out the reeking hypocrisy of Western elites and their never-ending attempts to dictate energy policy to countries in which they are not elected. Nevertheless, Modi’s bold step to tag western leaders with a “colonialist mindset” marks an important turn in global climate politics.
