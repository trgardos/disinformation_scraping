From Environmentalism to Climate Catastrophism: A Democratic Story,Ruy Teixeira,"Key Points

The environmental movement has always had an apocalyptic strain, going back to William Vogt’s 1948 bestseller, Road to Survival, which foresaw civilizational collapse unless economic growth and population were curtailed.

That apocalyptic strain was submerged during modern environmentalism’s rise in the 1960s, sparked by the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring; the movement’s rise prompted a raft of legislation in subsequent administrations to clean up the country’s air and water.

The apocalyptic strain resurfaced amid the anti–nuclear movement in the 1970s and ’80s, and scientific consensus in the 1990s that greenhouse gases were steadily warming the earth kicked off the climate change movement, which became radicalized as the difficulties of containing carbon emissions became apparent and lurid scenarios of the scale and rapidity of climate change effects entered the mainstream.

The Obama administration’s “all-of-the-above” approach to energy policy was rejected by Democrats who deemed the approach inadequate in averting the impending apocalypse, leading to a policy that is neither politically popular nor technically feasible—but which now dominates the Democratic Party and alienates working class voters.

As industrial development proceeded throughout the 20th century, stresses on nature became ever larger and more obvious, leading to the emergence of an apocalyptic strain in the conservation movement after World War II. The argument that economic and population growth would, if unchecked, destroy the environment and lead to civilizational collapse gained traction. Accompanying that strain was a milder ver­sion of the idea that directly challenged the old con­servation ethos: Simply conserving what remained of nature was not enough. The reality of the inter­dependent natural world meant that humankind’s activities were having dire effects everywhere on the planet—where people lived and where they didn’t. These activities were upsetting a finely balanced system, resulting in the degradation of nature, as con­ventionally understood, and people’s lives. Restoring and preserving that balance was what it meant to be an environmentalist.

The environmental movement proved enormously effective as a reform movement. While the book that inspired the modern environmental movement, Rachel Carson’s 1962 Silent Spring, veered toward the apocalyptic, the movement itself was laser-focused on practical reforms that would immedi­ately reduce pollution and safeguard the environ­ment. A raft of legislation followed, such as the Clean Air and Water Acts in the Johnson administration and, in the Nixon administration, the creation of the Environmental Protection Act and the prom­ulgation of the National Environmental Protection Act standards. This legislation and subsequent action radically reduced pollution of all kinds in the next decades.

But these reform successes did not eliminate envi­ronmentalism’s apocalyptic strain, which saw indus­trial society as an imminent threat to human life and the planet. Instead, a closer relationship evolved between mainstream environmentalism and a radical view of industrial society’s fundamental dangers. This was first manifest through the anti–nuclear power movement in the 1970s and was turbocharged by the 1979 Three Mile Island incident. Then in the 1990s, as a scientific consensus emerged that greenhouse gases were steadily warming the earth, this movement was superseded by the climate movement. Here was clear proof that industrial society and human civiliza­tion were counterposed. Initially meliorist in orienta­tion, the movement has become more radical as it has gathered strength. The quest to eliminate the possi­bility of dire scenarios has met the reality that indus­trial societies built on fossil fuels are likely to change only slowly, for political and technical reasons.

This has promoted a sense that radical action to transform industrial society must be taken immedi­ately. That view has gained hegemony in the Demo­cratic Party, supporting activist groups, and associated cultural elites. Practical objections about how quickly a “clean energy transition” can be pursued and con­cerns about how it will affect the economy are now outweighed for most Democrats by the mission’s per­ceived urgency. That has set Democrats apart from the working-class voters they aspire to represent, for whom these practical objections and concerns loom large. How to transition to clean energy has become a significant factor in the great divide that has opened between postindustrial metros and the rural areas, towns, and small cities of Middle America.

Letter: Electric Vehicles Won’t Save the Climate,Benjamin Zycher,"Note: This letter to the editor appeared in the Wall Street Journal on April 24, 2023, in response to the Journal’s April 19, 2023, op-ed titled “Biden and Media Are EV Grifters.”

Electric vehicles are preposterous, in particular as climate policy (“Biden and Media Are EV Grifters” by Holman Jenkins, Jr., Business World, April 19). The Environmental Protection Agency’s own climate model predicts that the proposed emissions standards for light, medium and heavy vehicles would reduce global temperatures in 2100 by 0.02-degrees Celsius.

Mr. Jenkins goes on to offer the Econ 101 argument for a carbon tax. This ignores the incentives of Congress when climate policy becomes a money machine and a host of other problems, among which is, again, the near-zero future temperature effect of any carbon tax that Congress might enact. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change argues that the carbon tax needed to achieve the purported 1.5-degree Celsius “safe” limit would have to be $35 per gallon of gasoline by 2030, in 2022 dollars, and rising sharply thereafter. No Congress will enact such a policy.

Earth Day 2023: Utterly Bereft of Ideas,Benjamin Zycher,"Earth Day falls on April 22 — Lenin’s birthday, appropriately enough — so let us first recall the blessed memory of the official theme for Earth Day 2022: “Invest In Our PlanetTM.” “This is the moment to change it all — the business climate, the political climate, and how we take action on climate. It’s going to take all of us. All in. Businesses, governments, and citizens — everyone accounted for, and everyone accountable. A partnership for the planet.”

Put aside the profound totalitarian implications of the “change it all” exhortation; suffice it to say that centralized attempts in the past to change everything uniformly have engendered mass murder by governments and attendant economic, environmental, and moral destruction. Focus instead on the official theme for Earth Day 2023: “Invest In Our PlanetTM.”

No, that is not a copy-and-paste error. Last year’s Earth Day slogan is this year’s Earth Day slogan. Given the shameless groveling by a long queue of corporate officials and public relations gasbags desperate to advertise their environmental bona fides so that the green alligators might eat them last, one would think that the massive financial support from the corporate boardrooms for the Earth Day charlatans might have financed a contract with a PR firm to come up with something new.

And one would be wrong. The basic imperatives of the Earth Day environmental left are eternal, immutable, unchanging, impervious to evidence, and utterly mindless. “Ensure that students across the worldbenefit from high-quality education to develop into informed and engaged environmental stewards.” Translation: Propagandize the young, Komsomol-style. “Sign the petition for a global plastics treaty.” Over three-quarters of ocean plastic pollution is discharged from rivers in Asia and other less-developed regions. (Your plastic straw is irrelevant.) Needless to say, the Earth Day proponents have not bothered to tell us how those governments can be induced to make the attendant massive changes; bribing them will not work because the western governments will prove curiously parsimonious, as the travails of the Green Climate Fund (part of the thunderously-applauded Paris Agreement) make clear.

And on and on. “Plant trees.” Yes, trees absorb carbon dioxide, but because forest canopies for the most part are dark, forest expansion would reduce albedo (reflective) effects, and the net impact is likely to be a small warming. Oops. As an aside, there are important benefits from mild warming, among them reduced mortality, planetary greening, and an increase in agricultural productivity. “Vote Earth,” by which the Earth Day campaign means “send us your contact information so that we can ask you for money.” “Global Cleanup,” the local neighborhood version of the crusade against plastics, except that the neighborhood mobilizations might actually yield some small measure of waste removal, presumably to be taken to local landfills, ironically not a favored outcome for the environmental left.

My favorite among the Earth Day 2023 nostrums is “Sustainable Fashion”: “Behind every piece of clothing in a store, there is an industry stripping the Earth of its limited resources and exploiting the labor force that works in its garment factories. Tremendous waste characterizes this industry as it depletes healthy soil, contaminates fresh water sources, pollutes the air we breathe, defiles our oceans, destroys forests and damages eco-systems and the health of their biodiversity.”

Wow. Who knew that blouses, blue jeans, and bras are mass murderers? And in the circular argument department, one floor up from the clothing aisles, Earth Day 2023 informs us that “In order for true recycling to take place, clothing must be collected, sorted and distributed to recyclers.” Do Earth Day staffers actually receive salaries to come up with such drivel? One wonders why the Earth Day proponents do not simply argue for a return to the pre-serpent nakedness of the Garden of Eden. After all, would that not eliminate a vast source of “unsustainability,” whatever that means?

Let me be blunt: The Earth Day initiatives are destructive silliness, a form of mass hysteria, and utterly unsubtle. It can surprise no one that the Earth Day propagandists now scream that “CLIMATE ACTION IS NOW THE BEST PATHWAY TO A STRONG ECONOMY.”

Oh, dear. One wonders why “climate action” requires massive subsidies and economic upheaval. The Earth Day proponents assert that “The cost of renewable energy has plummeted in the last decade,” but even if true (a deeply problematic premise) it is irrelevant in that the appropriate comparison is with the costs of conventional energy and electricity generation, and with the costs of renewables when combined with the costs of backup generation required to avoid constant service interruptions. Example: The cost of onshore wind power including backup capacity is four times greater than that of gas-fired electricity. Earth to Earth Day: There are enormous engineering and reliability problems inherent in wind and solar power, which cannot be wished away.

The cost realities for electric and hybrid plug-in vehicles yield the same conclusion: Unconventional (that is, expensive) energy is uncompetitive. Accordingly, the “climate action/strong economy” assertion is propaganda: Radically higher energy costs cannot engender economic wellbeing. Even the International Energy Agency — far from immune to the political pressures exerted by fashionable opinion and the environmental left — in its latest World Energy Outlook projects that by 2050 global oil consumption will be about equal to that in 2015, coal consumption about equal to that in 2010, and natural gas consumption higher than that in 2020. If we assume annual real GDP growth of only 1 percent, global GDP in 2050 will be a third higher than now. Trust me: The IEA projections will prove vastly too low.

But the Earth Day beat goes on. Many billions of people are little more than environmentally destructive mouths to feed, without moral standing and devoid of the ingenuity, intelligence, and inventiveness to solve problems. They are, therefore, environmental sinners, and only massive economic destruction and impoverishment can redeem mankind. And just as the pagans for millennia attempted to prevent destructive weather by worshipping golden idols, so now does the Earth Day congregation attempt to prevent environmental Armageddon by bowing down before recycling bins.

The Earth Day revision of the Old Testament might read: “In the Beginning, Earth was the Garden of Eden. But Mankind, having consumed the Forbidden Fruit of the Tree of Technological Knowledge, has despoiled it. And only through repentance and widespread suffering can we return to the loving embrace of Mother Gaia.” Dogbert’s version is pithier: “You can’t save the earth unless you’re willing to make other people sacrifice.” Truer words were never spoken.","April 21, 2023",Article,AEI,https://www.aei.org/articles/earth-day-2023-utterly-bereft-of-ideas/
OPEC Remains an Obstacle for Biden’s Green-Energy Fantasy,"Benjamin Zycher, James Pethokoukis","Can it surprise anyone that the multiple Biden–administration gambits intended to save the planet are proving perverse in every possible dimension? This is the case in particular for the fossil-fuel industry, both in the U.S. and internationally: In a nutshell, the administration seeks a long-term decline in investment and production on deeply dubious “climate” grounds, while at the same time begging foreign producers to increase output so as to moderate politically damaging price increases in the here and now.

Nor can it come as a surprise that the Biden policies have increased the market power of foreign producers, the latest manifestation of which is the recent decision by OPEC+ to cut crude-oil output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (mmbd). This is in addition to the production cut of about 2 mmbd announced last October, which was “criticized by the White House.” It seems that the White House lately has come to recognize its impotence, as it responded to the latest announcement by expressing “disagree[ment]” with the OPEC+ announcement and calling it “inadvisable.” That’ll show ’em — as will the powerful proclamation from the president that “it’s not going to be as bad as you think.”

Let us review some basics. Global crude-oil output is approximately 100 mmbd. U.S. output declined from about 12.3 mmbd in 2019 to 11.9 mmbd in 2022, with an uptick more recently, but we must not allow such short-term fluctuations to obscure the larger realities. A conservative estimate of potential U.S. production capacity is 13.5 mmbd, but it is clear that the Biden policies have yielded and will continue to yield a reduction in investment in exploration, development, field operations, pipelines and other ancillary capital, and the like. A reasonable estimate of that longer-term output level is roughly 9 mmbd, which was the approximate average annual U.S. production from 2010 to 2019.

Accordingly, the market must expect the net effect of Biden-administration policies to be a decline in annual U.S. production over the medium and longer terms of almost 5 mmbd, as a rough approximation. A compensating increase in overseas production is problematic at best, because global excess production capacity was less than 4 mmbd in 2022, engineering realities prevent the use of all excess capacity, and market forces will not allow a reduction in excess capacity to very low levels except under the most extreme circumstances. Moreover, the Biden administration and international lending agencies are reducing international financing of fossil-fuel projects in the developing world, and much of the developed world continues to pretend to believe green dogma in opposition to fossil fuels, although it does seem that reality is beginning to exert an influence. But at a minimum, the economic risks of investing in fossil-fuel-production capacity clearly have increased: The same political imperatives driving oil markets now are likely to continue.

Under reasonable assumptions about demand and supply conditions, the expected decline in long-run U.S. output attendant upon the Biden policies — roughly 5 percent of global output — would result in a long-run global price increase of at least 20 percent. And that (or more) is what we have seen since early 2021. The economic recovery from the Covid downturn explains only a small part of this; it is the expectation of future price increases for crude oil that has the effect of driving current prices up, because market forces allocate production over time so that at any given moment the expected market-price path rises at the market rate of interest. Nor can the administration blame the dollar exchange rate for this, as the real dollar index has increased by almost 12 percent since January 2021.

The upshot is that the Biden policies will increase the longer-term OPEC+ market share from about 51 percent in 2022 to 55 percent or more over time. That may not look like much, but the decline in U.S. production capacity will allow OPEC+ to exercise more market power, even with the obvious frictions within the group. Again under reasonable assumptions about market conditions, the increase in market share — the increase in OPEC+’s perception of its market power — will result in a longer-term price increase from, say, $75–80 per barrel to around $100.

Because the Biden administration is unlikely to undertake the actual reforms that would reverse these adverse outcomes, poor substitutes now are being proposed, the most prominent of which is the reintroduction of “NOPEC” legislation, which would allow the Justice Department to sue OPEC for purported price fixing. The problems with this idea are legion, but in a nutshell: The reaction from the Saudis and others would not be salutary, because control of their oil-production policies is not a second-order consideration for them. Another production cut in retaliation would be likely. U.S. litigation against OPEC generally or the Saudis in particular would strengthen a Saudi–Russian oil alliance, not an outcome that would further U.S. interests. The investments of U.S. firms in their territories would not be immune to various kinds of retaliation. More broadly, the NOPEC proposal is an attack on the sovereign immunity of national governments. Whatever the virtues and downsides of that time-tested system, the impacts of eroding it will be complex and difficult to predict in advance.

Back to the newest OPEC+ production cut. We can quibble about the numbers, and political factors obviously will exert a substantial influence. There is considerable uncertainty about the political viability of the crusade against fossil fuels, as many Europeans, Californians, and others are learning to their surprise and consternation. But the central principle is incontrovertible: The Biden policies will reduce U.S. output and increase international prices, and thus transfer enormous wealth from Americans to Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the other foreign oil producers. Nor will this prove salutary for the lives of many hundreds of millions of the world’s poor, for whom energy both efficient and inexpensive — fossil fuels — is a central component of an escape from grinding poverty. Can Biden possibly justify such perverse outcomes with more than a rote “climate” mantra? Well, no. Do he and the rest of his administration care? Ditto.","April 17, 2023",Article,AEI,https://www.aei.org/articles/opec-remains-an-obstacle-for-bidens-green-energy-fantasy/
Comment to the Department of Energy: Proposed Rule on Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Conventional Cooking Products,Benjamin Zycher,"Summary

The estimates on benefits and costs asserted by the Department of Energy (DoE) in the proposed rule on “Energy Conservation Standards for Consumer Conventional Cooking Products” demonstrate that it cannot satisfy any plausible benefit/cost test. The maximum annual consumer savings in the DoE lifecycle analysis is for gas cooking tops, asserted by DoE to be $1.51 per year per unit. That number is too small to differ from zero as a matter of statistical significance; the figures for the other cooking technologies are smaller, and in most cases are effectively zero. Accordingly, the savings, whether delineated in dollars or units of energy, are too small to satisfy the legal requirements promulgated under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA).

Nor does the DoE analysis examine the forgone service quality characteristics to be lost under the proposed rule. If DoE is correct that the savings, again whether delineated in dollars or units of energy, are sufficiently significant to satisfy the requirements of the EPCA, then unless DoE asserts that consumers are irrational — which it does not do — then it must be the case that the forgone service quality characteristics, if monetized, are greater than the asserted savings. A continued pursuit of the specifics of this rule, accordingly, is inconsistent with the central principle underlying support for a market economy, to wit, a definition of economic value as revealed by consumer preferences reflected in market prices. If DoE views consumers as irrational, it should say that explicitly, justify it, and justify as well the implicit premise that DoE officials and staff are more rational.

The DoE assertion of climate benefits is preposterous, as a straightforward application of the DoE estimates of the reductions in GHG emissions to the EPA climate model, under assumptions that exaggerate the effects of such reductions, yields a prediction of a temperature decline in 2100 of 0.005°C, a figure effectively equal to zero, and undetectable in any event given the standard deviation of the surface temperature record. DoE attempts to circumvent this obvious problem by using instead the interim IWG estimates of the social cost of carbon, but those estimates are fatally flawed and heavily politicized, in that they (1) distort the actual economic growth predictions produced by the integrated assessment models, (2) base predictions of future climate phenomena on climate models that cannot predict the past or the present, (3) incorporate “co-benefits” in the form of a reduction in the emissions of other criteria and hazardous air pollutants already regulated under different provisions of the Clean Air Act, (4) incorporate the asserted benefits of GHG reductions on a global basis, and (5) employ discount rates that are inconsistent and inappropriate.

In short, the proposed rule cannot satisfy any basic standard of analytic rigor, a plausible benefit/cost test in particular. It should not be finalized in this form.

The Working Class Isn’t Down with the Green Transition,Ruy Teixeira,"Nothing defines the Democratic economic strategy more than a single-minded focus on fighting climate change—an “existential crisis” as Biden, other top Democrats and a galaxy of Democratic-leaning pundits have termed it. In practice this has meant restructuring the economy around “green” industries and a rapid transition to an energy system based around wind and solar. Democratic elites and activists are very, very committed to this approach and are willing to pay high costs to make it happen. In the end, they assert, not only will the existential crisis be averted, but everyone will be happy and prosperous. In the meantime—well, you can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs!

But did anyone ask the working class whether they wanted to sign up in the climate change army? Public opinion data have repeatedly indicated that the climate change issue does not have high salience for these voters and they are not terribly interested in making sacrifices for the cause. Recent data underscore these voters’ lack of commitment.

In a new Monmouth poll, just one percent of working-class (noncollege) voters in an open-ended question identify climate change as the biggest concern facing their family. On the other hand, half of working-class voters say actions of the federal government in the last six months have actually hurt their family’s main concern; only 9 percent say federal action has helped. And 55 percent of working-class voters believe that “middle-class families” have not been helped at all by Biden’s policies. Hmm… The Biden administration is putting on the full court press for electric vehicles. But the working class is not too interested. In a new Gallup poll, just 2 percent of working-class respondents say they currently own an electric vehicle and a mere 9 percent say they are “seriously considering” purchasing one. The University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute in collaboration with AP-NORC has been doing an annual survey on climate attitudes. This year’s survey finds less, not more, urgency around climate change. Compared to a high point in 2018, there was an 11-point drop in the proportion of Americans overall and among those with a high school education or less saying climate change is caused entirely or mostly by human activity. The survey also finds little interest in regulatory moves to phase out gas-powered cars in favor of electric vehicles (EVs). Just 27 percent of Americans favor requiring all new vehicles to be EVs or plug-in hybrids by 2035 as in California and several other states. It is safe to assume that support among working-class voters is less than that modest figure. (The new data do not provide many breakouts by demographic group.) Critically, in terms of costs Americans would be willing to absorb to fight climate change, the survey finds that just 38 percent of Americans would be willing to pay even $1 extra on their monthly household energy expenses to combat climate change. That’s the lowest figure since AP-NORC started asking this question in 2016. It’s down 14 points since 2021 and an amazing 19 points since its high point in 2018. Extrapolating from analysis I did of the microdata from previous surveys, this suggests that around 30 percent of working-class Americans today would be willing to pay that extra dollar a month to fight climate change. And then when you’re talking about the princely sum of $10 a month, working-class support is probably around 18 percent.

That’s pretty low! I just don’t see how you can get the working class to support a clean energy transition unless it becomes more of a crusade for abundant, cheap, reliable energy and less about the cultural commitment of college-educated Democrats to an economy built around wind, solar, and electric vehicles no matter the cost. The working class is not on board with the latter though it could be interested in the former.

An energy abundance approach would recognize that, in fact, Biden has done the right thing by greenlighting the Willow oil-drilling project in Alaska. Of course, the climate activists and punditocracy are furious and denunciations are pouring in. But this is exactly what working-class voters do want: an “all of the above” strategy that pushes forward renewables while continuing to use a mix of energy sources including fossil fuels. And what they want corresponds to the most practical course in pursuing a clean energy transition while assuring a reliable and secure supply of cheap energy. To go against this approach, as climate activists are pressuring Biden to do, is to accentuate the Great Divide between postindustrial metros and middle America, between Democratic elites and the working class.

Really, it’s madness. Biden needs to do more not less on moving the Democratic Party away from its obsession with renewables. Instead of waxing apoplectic about the Willow project, why aren’t climate activists demanding the radical restructuring of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission? The NRC’s new regulations for next-generation reactors run to 1200 pages and will effectively stymie a desperately needed nuclear renaissance in the country and indeed around the world if allowed to stand. Where are the demonstrations outside NRC headquarters? Instead, crickets as the NRC torpedoes the clean energy source most compatible with an industrial economy.

No wonder the working class doesn’t trust these guys. They’re more committed to their ideology than to their alleged end goals—and certainly than they are to the welfare of the working class.","April 13, 2023",Op-Ed,AEI,https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-working-class-isnt-down-with-the-green-transition/
The EPA Regulatory Reconsideration of Fine Particulates,"Benjamin Zycher, James Pethokoukis, Phil Gramm, Hester Peirce","I betray no secret when I report that much regulatory policy has been deeply politicized, and that is a vast understatement when it comes to many EPA actions under the Clean Air Act. Consider the regulation — the promulgation of a new National Ambient Air Quality Standard — of fine particulate matter (“PM2.5”), which, under the terms of the CAA, EPA is required to review every five years in light of “the best available science.”

Get real. A new rule was promulgated in December 2020, satisfying all of the public notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. It maintained the standard adopted in the previous rule from 2012, precisely because there is little evidence that a further tightening would yield any beneficial aggregate health benefits at all. Under the schedule required under the law, a new rule would be required in 2025, by which year “the best available science” might have advanced sufficiently to justify a different NAAQS. But because the Biden administration took office in 2021, adherence to the schedule mandated legally would not further its political interests.

And so only a few weeks after the official publication of the 2020 rule in the Federal Register that December, President Biden issued an executive order directing the EPA to reconsider it. Suffice it to say that “the best available science” did not change between December 2020 and January 2021, with the exception of one new study that EPA itself describes as “narrow” and not useful for purposes of new “conclusions.” What did change, of course, was the occupant of the oval office, the leadership of the EPA, and the political imperative to satisfy the demands of the political left to tighten the environmental screws in every possible dimension regardless of the actual analytics. EPA now proposes “to revise the primary annual PM2.5 standard by lowering the level from 12.0 [micrograms per cubic meter] to within the range of 9.0 to 10.0 μg/m3 while taking comment on alternative annual standard levels down to 8.0 μg/m3 and up to 11.0 μg/m3.”

That last bit about considering an alternative “up to 11.0 μg/m3” is amusing; can anyone believe that this administration will be willing to invite opprobrium from the environmental left in an effort to make its standards a bit less unreasonable? In any event, EPA cannot claim any sort of PM2.5 health emergency as a rationale for rushing things: Between 2000-2021 national average ambient concentrations declined by 37 percent, to about 8.0 μg/m3 over the last five years. Bakst and Lewis note that the improvements have occurred in every region of the country, and U.S. PM2.5 levels are among the lowest in the world, lower by 20 percent than those in France, Germany, and the UK.

EPA states in the new proposed rule that various analyses of human and animal exposures to very high PM2.5 yield no actual evidence that current ambient concentrations create important mortality risks. EPA circumvents that problem by emphasizing “observational” studies that examine raw correlations without controlling for other important factors that might affect the relevant mortality statistics. Because PM2.5 is everywhere, everyone is exposed to it on a constant basis, so that simple correlations are deeply problematic in terms of drawing conclusions important for regulatory policy.

It gets worse. EPA claims billions of dollars of net benefits (Table 2) from a prospective tightening of the PM2.5 NAAQS, despite the weakness conceded by EPA with respect to the overall epidemiological evidence. How does EPA arrive at that conclusion? They take the nonsensical observational correlations noted above, attribute to PM2.5 as many as 570,000 U.S. deaths per year, and apply a value to each statistical lost life of $10 million. So in the never-never land of EPA “analysis,” there might be $5.7 trillion in economic benefits available. EPA actually claims a figure of up to $100 billion for net benefits depending on the policy chosen; they seem actually to believe that they are being conservative.

The $10 million figure is consistent with the academic literature, but it is deeply misleading, in that it necessarily is independent of the ages of the statistical individuals losing their lives, and other crucial factors central to the PM2.5 issue. To the extent that PM2.5 at current levels is responsible for actual premature deaths — a deeply dubious proposition — one would expect that such deaths would be concentrated among individuals older, less healthy overall, suffering from other adverse health conditions, in all likelihood poorer, and on and on. EPA makes no effort to control for such relevant factors — it may be impossible to do so on the basis of the simple correlations reported in the observational studies — a failure that does not inspire confidence in the rigor of the analysis underlying the proposed rule.

For those interested in ever-greater regulation, PM2.5 is a gold mine. Over many years, EPA has justified tightened regulations under the CAA by claiming PM2.5 “co-benefits” created by proposed regulations of other pollutants. One study in 2011 found that of 26 CAA regulations of other pollutants, asserted PM2.5 co-benefits accounted for more than half of the asserted net benefits of 21, and more than 99 percent of the asserted net benefits of 11.

Ever-tighter regulation of PM2.5 is a game designed to increase the political power of the EPA and its allies in the White House, in Congress, and among ideological, geographic, and industrial interest groups. It is deeply perverse in terms of its potential to constrain severely economic development in numerous regions of the country. But here we are.","April 10, 2023",Article,AEI,https://www.aei.org/articles/the-epa-regulatory-reconsideration-of-fine-particulates/
‘Extrapolations’ Imagines a Dystopian Climate Future Leading to Nowhere. Because Humans Suck.,James Pethokoukis,"“I think that our pulp fiction has done us a disservice, creating a commonsense assumption that we are one power failure away from Mad Max: Fury Road. The reality is ever so much messier, full of people trying to do the right thing—which still causes high-stakes, serious conflicts, but they’re conflicts of good faith and sincere disagreement.”- Cory Doctorow.

The Essay

☀ ‘Extrapolations’ imagines a dystopian climate future leading to nowhere. Because humans suck.

Full transparency: I’ll admit to being genuinely moved by a plotline in Extrapolations, the new Apple TV+ anthology series about a future climate-change dystopia, where an animal DNA archivist converses with the last humpback whale. (In the sultry year 2046, humans have cracked the code of all those clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls of Megaptera novaeangliae, as did the protagonist aliens in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.) Maybe it was the premise of anticipatory melancholy or saudade or maybe it was the top-notch voice acting of Meryl Streep as the forlorn momma whale, but the whale-whispering scenes worked for me.

But not much else in Extrapolations worked for me despite the star-spangled cast and great visuals. The budget is all there on the screen. Unfortunately, show creator Scott Burns displays little growth in understanding the evolving climate issue since he produced An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore’s 2006 documentary film about global warming. Nor has he cracked the code on effectively communicating the importance of the issue to that species of American who’s either uninterested or skeptical. And that’s still a lot of us, despite a drumbeat of scientific warnings and Hollywood treatments. Remember, it was only back in 2021 when Don’t Look Up, another big-budget, star-studded effort, was supposed to change public perceptions.

Yet look at where we are nearly two decades after An Inconvenient Truth: In a Washington Post-ABC News poll taken just before the midterm elections last year, just 46 percent of independents and 27 percent of Republicans said climate change was very important to their vote. Making more flashy media that appeals to the 80 percent of Democrats who already worry a lot about climate change seems like a waste of money and star power. While ongoing climate impacts may eventually change that polling, even 100 more episodes of Extrapolations with even more stars and even bigger budgets would be highly unlikely to. At times Extrapolations almost seems to be intentionally trolling the big chunk of the American public that remains unmoved by the threat of climate change.

The opening scene of the series presents a 2037 version of a foul-mouthed, Greta Thunbergian youth activist lecturing the world via hologram. Who does Burns think will find that persuasive as opposed to repellant? Same with another environmentally concerned teen who calls the FBI on her father, a real estate developer who had bribed Florida’s Department of Sea Level Mitigation to get seawall protection for their synagogue. (Some conservatives will surely be reminded of the legend of Soviet youth squealer Pavlik Mororzov.)

Although the series seems to revolve around the dangers of letting global temperatures rise more than 2°C, the series suggests the impact of doing so goes far beyond current research, that Earth would be well on its way to becoming nearly uninhabitable by century’s end — the sort of outcome from temperature increases more like 5°C by 2100. (Crowds chant, “If we go to two, the end of me and you!”) Yet the latest scientific consensus is that such scenarios are no longer plausible. Does Burns think no one would notice that inconsistency?

Where are the nuclear reactors? In the real world, we seem to be at the beginning of a nuclear renaissance in terms of public acceptance, new fission technology, and a key breakthrough in nuclear fusion. But the futures of Extrapolations seem to limit tech progress to solar power only. That, even though energy-intensive desalination technology seems widespread. “Where are the nuclear reactors?” seems a question that many of the viewers Burns is trying to persuade would ask.

This brings us to a deeper problem: At the heart of Extrapolations is the old-school, environmentalist notion that the planet’s big problem is rapacious, tech-capitalist humanity, a super-consumerist swarm that’s not-so-slowly devouring the natural bounty of Mother Earth. We are a species of liars who will even lie to the last noble humpback whale. And there’s no lie more destructive than the lie we tell ourselves: Humanity has the agency and smarts to fix the problems our prosperity causes even as we create even greater abundance.

It’s an ethos represented in Nicholas Bilton, an Elon Musk-type character — world’s richest person, techno-capitalist — who gets ever richer as the climate gets more chaotic. He cares only about how to cleverly profit from catastrophe. As the series moves forward and his empire grows — casinos, desalination tech, sea mining, social media — evil motives become clearer. Sure, his company’s Menagerie2100 division may seem like it’s doing a good thing by creating a DNA library of animals on the verge of extinction, such as humpback whales. But then the company also kills those animals so a rival firm can’t catalog their genes. When early on Bilton says, “It is entirely possible that the limits we have created for business are limiting our ability to solve the problem of climate,” the show has already made it clear that it rejects the notion.

But again, in the real world, private enterprise is proving critical to creating clean energy solutions from advanced nuclear to geothermal to carbon capture and removal. To appreciate those efforts, however, one has to see climate change as a clean energy problem rather than a human consumption problem. But 1970’s-style, Limits to Growth environmentalism sees abundant clean energy as only further enabling more capitalistic consumption.

All of this is too bad because art has a key role in creating aspirational and inspirational images of the future. Extrapolations, however, only encourages humanity to either go down a dead-end path — scarcity and degrowth — or no path at all because it’s all utterly hopeless. As the show puts it, “Human suck.” And how do we change that with public policy?

Why We Should Cheer That Earth’s Population Just Passed 8 Billion,James Pethokoukis,"To paraphrase Soylent Green — that Down Wing, cinematic classic of techno-pessimism—economic growth is made out of people having ideas. “The more people there are searching for new ideas, the more likely it is that discoveries will be made,” observes economist Charles I. Jones in the paper “The Facts of Economic Growth.”

For population worriers, those who only see one more human aboard Spaceship Earth as one more mouth to feed, it’s troubling that according to the UN, global population hit eight billion last year. Arguing against that doomster mentality is science journalist Leigh Phillips, who recently wrote “Hurrah for 8 Billion Humans” for Compact. Here’s my recent email chat with Phillips:

1/ Has anti-humanist/overpopulation thinking changed over the decades since its popular emergence in the environmental movement, or are these the same old ideas in 2023?

There have been perhaps three major pulses of overpopulationism, or more correctly, ‘malthusianism’. The Reverend Thomas Malthus in the 18th Century was the first who warned that human population growth, an exponential, was at risk of outstripping agriculture, whose outputs only grew linearly. His belief that the working classes’ supposed tendency to procreate was what led to the existence of poverty led some 19th century politicians to oppose charity or poor relief laws as counterproductive as this would only result in greater numbers of these lower orders.

Understandably then, 19th century radicals, including Karl Marx, considered malthusianism a villainy, as it placed blame for class society on the supposed loose sexual morals of the poor rather than on the capitalist system. While those who today fret about overpopulation or overconsumption such as Greta Thunberg or Jane Goodall might be thought of as on the left, or at least green left, the classical left viewed Malthusianism as an ideological enemy.

And it wasn’t just about the aristocratic contempt for the working class that provoked the ire of these early socialists. Friedrich Engels also attacked malthusian thought for ignoring the possibility of technological progress, saying that scientific knowledge also advances at an exponential rate: “And what is impossible to science?” Again, while today there is widespread technological pessimism on the left, dismissing any possibility of improvement via innovation as mere ‘techno-fixes’, Engels was attacking Malthus and his co-thinkers for their technological pessimism!

The origins of the organic farming movement for example are to be found in the interwar far-right, and its Blud und Boden (blood and soil) belief that industry had severed man’s connection to the land.

Then, in the late 19th and early 20th Century, the critics of industrial modernity and its alleged excesses, its breaches of ‘natural limits’, were to be found on the reactionary, Counter-Enlightenment right, not the left—the sort of people who opposed the American and French Revolutions and their democratic offspring elsewhere, and wanted a return to absolute rule. The origins of the organic farming movement for example are to be found in the interwar far-right, and its Blud und Boden (blood and soil) belief that industry had severed man’s connection to the land.

Post-war such ideas largely disappeared, associated as they were with the losers of the Second World War. Then in the 1960s, as awareness rose of genuine problems of air, land and water pollution, overpopulationism rose once again as an explanation for these problems. These new Malthusians were not focussed on food supplies alone, but resource exhaustion in general. forecasting far worse to come if restrictions on immigration, one-child policies and sterilization programs were not adopted. Biologist Paul Ehrlich and his wife Anne wrote The Population Bomb, predicting global famine by the 1980s. Paul was repeatedly invited on to the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson to promulgate these views while his wife would go on to try to get the Sierra Club to adopt anti-immigration laws that would make Trump blush.

Such thinking only returned in recent years in response to the current challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss and allied environmental issues, primarily on the green left in the form of ‘degrowth’, ‘anti-consumerism’, localism, organic agriculture’s fear of industry and synthetic chemistry and so on, but there are many figures in the centre and on the right, even far right that embrace this neo-malthusianism as well. The green left’s embrace of such thinking however flies in the face of the classical left’s emphasis on expanding the forces of production.

2/ You note that climate concerns are having a real effect on family formation habits, including among Republicans. How did anti-natalism become so mainstream?

I think it’s because climate change, biodiversity loss and so on really are profound challenges. Pretty much all of modern life, almost all economic sectors, are closely bound up with the use of fossil fuels or some other mechanism of production of greenhouse gas emissions.

I feel that catastrophism is unwarranted. I get frustrated at the unscientific exaggerations of publications chasing clicks and engagement like the Guardian. But I do also worry about the intensity of heatwaves many places in the Middle East and India are experiencing. I worry about potential impacts of warming on some of the world’s bread baskets. I worry that the rate (though not volume) of our carbon emissions exceeds that of the large igneous provinces of the deep geological past (basically supervolcanoes) that likely played such a big role in many of the planet’s major mass extinction events. That latter datum in particular keeps me up at night.

Economic pessimism and thence disenchantment with humanity at a time of genuine environmental problems is not going to only affect the left.

At the same time, so many people, not just on the left, have become pessimistic about the possibility of change, of progress and transformation. The West has experienced more than four decades of economic stagnation, deindustrialisation, and austerity. Many sectors have experienced real wage stagnation, little movement in productivity and there has been a steady uptick in economic inequality since the 1970s/80s. Compare this with the radical improvements in standards of living that the immediate postwar generations experienced. Many political scientists have argued how such economic dislocation and stagnation, and the inability of the left to respond to this, makes for fertile ground for right-wing populism from Trump to the hard-right figures doing so well in Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Economic pessimism and thence disenchantment with humanity at a time of genuine environmental problems is not going to only affect the left.

Amidst such lack of optimism and hope, is it any wonder that narratives of millenarian doom and human ‘sinfulness’ are embraced, right across the political spectrum?

3/ In your piece, you write that overpopulation alarmists “suffer from an unscientific presentism” — the belief that “the current assemblage of species and current set of conditions on Earth must always remain so for their own sake.” What’s the alternative view you advocate?

There is no balance of nature; instead there is only constant, dynamic ecological and evolutionary flux. The late evolutionary biologist and palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould put it well when he said that the planet isn’t fragile, but we humans are.

A much hotter world is not bad for life on earth—as Gould put it, “The worst scenario of global warming under greenhouse models yields an earth substantially cooler than many happy and prosperous times of a prehuman past.”

So the criticism of neo-malthusianism in its various guises isn’t at all that we shouldn’t care about climate change or other environmental challenges, but that we should care about them because the niche of the current set of environmental conditions is what we humans evolved into; it’s what provides us the ecosystem services upon which we humans depend. A much hotter world is not bad for life on earth—as Gould put it, “The worst scenario of global warming under greenhouse models yields an earth substantially cooler than many happy and prosperous times of a prehuman past.” And even mass extinctions are necessary for subsequent evolutionary radiation (There would have been no mammalian domination without the removal of non-avian dinosaurs). Extinction is as necessary for evolution as death is for life.

And so if what we are doing results in a mass extinction event, well, that’s just another chapter in the history of evolution. What comes after, like mammals after dinosaurs, could be very interesting indeed—perhaps many more weedy, hardy species that are able to rapidly adapt to new circumstances such as rats, raccoons or pigeons.

But—and this is the key point—we humans certainly don’t want to live through such a mass extinction event! It would be catastrophic for us, and could even kill us off. So in many respects, what we are trying to do with respect to environmental protection is in our own self-interest: we want to ‘freeze’ the current assemblage and ecological conditions, and avoid any more grand evolutionary/ecological transformations so that we can continue to prosper.

So I advocate an explicitly humanist environmentalism; one that recognizes human exceptionalism. We should organize our relations to the rest of the nature on the basis of our supreme moral importance. Of course, the flip side of avoiding harm to ecosystem services in the interest of humans is optimizing ecosystem services in the interest of humans.

If we can, for example, alter the flow of rivers to improve upon those services (as we do with hydroelectric dams), then it is morally imperative that we do so. Via the production of synthetic fertilizer, we have radically transformed what heretofore existed as the nitrogen cycle. Traditional environmentalists, believing in the presentism I was talking about, throw their hands up in horror at such a transformation of nature on a geological scale.

I would say: this single act has saved the lives of billions of humans who might otherwise have died of maltnutrition or starvation. Good. In the 1970s, we consciously eradicated the variola viruses that cause smallpox when we eradicated that disease. That is we deliberate caused an extinction. Good. And now we have the technological ability to consciously eradicate the species of mosquitoes—humanity’s greatest enemy, likely killing more of us that all wars combined—that spread diseases such as malaria, Chikungunya and West Nile. Good. We are optimizing ecosystem services by doing so.

4/ You write, “Whatever humans are doing—from climate change to agriculture’s land-use change to the invention and dispersal of plastics—represents only nature’s latest set of evolutionary-selection pressures.” But doesn’t the magnitude of humanity’s “selection pressures” constitute a unique imposition on the evolutionary record?

Our changes are still very modest compared to, for example, cyanobacteria’s oxygenation of the atmosphere. There is no way that humanity’s selection pressures could eliminate life on earth (while the Great Oxygenation Event may have come close to it!). Let me turn it around the other way: evolution has had no life-on-earth preservation fail-safe mechanism until we came along. To be sure, the end of life on earth that will begin some 600 million to a billion years from now as the sun’s increase in luminosity sets in motion a chain of events that will kill everything off, even possibly bacteria a few aeons years hence. That’s of course a very, very, very long time off—longer than the period between today and the first emergence of complex life.

Still, we are the only species capable of technological innovation, and thus the only species that can devise ways to escape this endgame for all of life, to explore, colonize and terraform other worlds, or maybe to slowly move Earth to a safer orbit, or—truly fantastical, very distant, far, far future stuff—re-engineer the sun. The rest of life on earth cannot save life on earth, but we can. Our “unique imposition on the evolutionary record” will be, as Freeman Dyson put it, “the greening of the cosmos”.

5/ “We should want to avoid dangerous climate change and biodiversity loss not because the planet is fragile—it isn’t—but because we humans are fragile.” Do the environment or other species deserve any preservation or protection for their own sake, or is the value of the natural world purely subordinated to human preferences?

No species deserves preservation for its own sake; it cannot be so, otherwise evolution could not exist.

I also reject the current fad for criticizing our ‘speciesism’, comparing valuing human life over that of other species to the other isms of racism, sexism, antisemitism and so on, equating, as the vegan group PETA did, the production of pork to the Holocaust. There is indeed a moral hierarchy in nature. We humans are uniquely capable of morality. It is we humans who were debating whether it was right to kill Harambe the gorilla when a toddler fell into his enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo. Harambe and the other gorillas had no capacity to debate whether it was right to harm or kill the toddler.

None of this is in any way incompatible with the extension of a considerable duty of care to many other animals—especially those whose attributes begin to approach our own. I very much support improving animal welfare and the development, for example, of lab meat (although I have no problems with animal testing for important medical research). In fact, I suspect that the reason that so many people have in recent decades begun to advocate so strongly for the welfare of the Great Apes, cetaceans such as whales and dolphins, and even octopuses is precisely because research has shown us how closely these species approach us in their attributes. That is, our concern for Harambe flows from an implicit recognition of this moral hierarchy in nature, with humans at its apex.

6/ What does a pro-human environmentalism look like?

It begins with soberly, objectively, considering the technology-switching options that will enable us to avoid dangerous climate change, biodiversity loss where it harms us, nitrogen pollution, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and the full suite of environmental challenges. But if an anthropogenic transformation of ecosystems results in a net benefit to humans, then there is a moral imperative to proceed with it. So it is not just about avoiding harms (although that is the main priority at the moment, and likely will be so for a few decades yet), but also about optimizing ecosystems to our benefit.

Again, the Earth itself does not care what its average temperature is (within, obviously, the Goldilocks Zone bounds).

An example here would be optimizing the Earth’s temperature. Once we’ve made sure that we’re avoiding 1.5 to 2C of global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, we can begin a net removal of atmospheric carbon to dial the thermostat back down to an optimum level. But what is that optimum level? Again, the Earth itself does not care what its average temperature is (within, obviously, the Goldilocks Zone bounds). Is zero degrees above pre-industrial temperatures best for us? If so, what is special about that temperature? Maybe the best temperature for human flourishing is 0.8 degrees above that, or maybe a little below.

7/ Is the sort of anti-humanism you describe strictly a left-wing phenomenon in the US, or does it exist on the right?

King Charles and his offspring embrace this anti-humanism, and I don’t know if they’re particularly socialist given they’re, well, royalty. And we have had three major mass shootings perpetrated by men who call themselves eco-fascists in their manifestos published online, saying that the earth is overpopulated, that humans overconsume, and the rest of the neo-malthusian canards. The Sierra Club in the 1990s had a raging internal fight over whether they should adopt a hard anti-immigration stance. The German government has a special unit dedicated to countering far-right infiltration of environmental groups. There are dozens of other examples of this.

I would turn this question on its head and say that neo-malthusianism in all its forms has always been a right-wing phenomenon originating in the Counter-Enlightenment’s antipathy toward modernity, democracy and the industrial revolution’s overturning of what aristocratic elites felt was the natural order, an upending of the balance of nature. The adoption of neo-malthusianism by the green left amounts to their adoption of Counter-Enlightenment ideas and rejection of the traditional left’s celebration of the capacity of industrial modernity to deliver abundance, a reduction of scarcity and thus provide the material foundation for equality.

8/ You argue that Ecological Footprints assume “there can’t be technological development whose efficiency gains boost productive capacity, even as the required material or energetic inputs from the environment declines.” Why is this such an important point?

The limits to growth and ecological footprints concepts assume that as the number of humans or the economy grows, negative environmental impacts increase in concert. To give an historic example of where this plainly is not the case, we can look to the last major existential environmental threat: the deterioration of the ozone layer, which was as big in the popular imagination by the 1980s as climate change is today. Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, used in all sorts of products, from fridges to cans of hairspray, were primarily responsible. An international treaty, the Montreal Protocol, regulated a phase-out of these chemicals, to be replaced by other ones that could still allow us to have fridges and cans of hairspray.

Today however, the ozone layer is on track to being fully healed by mid-century, and there are more fridges and cans of hairspray than there ever was.

This is called technology-switching, which allows for a decoupling of human activity from negative environmental impacts. Instead of technology-switching, the overconsumptist position would have limited the number of fridges and cans of hairspray there could be, or simply banned them altogether. Today however, the ozone layer is on track to being fully healed by mid-century, and there are more fridges and cans of hairspray than there ever was.

And we see this in sector after sector. The author Andrew McAfee has written a book detailing such decoupling across dozens of industries. Where he and I disagree though is the role of government in decoupling. Private-sector competition can result in this decoupling of its own accord, but only where it is profitable. If it isn’t profitable, those private actors won’t engage in such technology-switching to enable decoupling. There are a range of other factors that are necessary for technology-switching to occur, including public funding of research and development in universities and government labs, public buildout of infrastructure where risk-averse private sector actors are scared off by high upfront capital costs (such as the case of conventional nuclear power), industrial policy to shepherd new technologies from lab bench, pilot project and startup through to commercialisation and competitiveness, containing supply-chain volatility, and planning workforce development—and of course (smart) regulation as well!

9/ Why do you think so many population-concerned activists are so against abundant, clean energy, especially nuclear?

The anti-nuclear movement was founded by figures such as Amory Lovins who feared that bountiful energy from nuclear would allow human populations and consumption to expand without limit. “It’d be little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean, cheap, abundant energy because of what we would do with it,” Lovins said in the 1970s. “We ought to be looking for energy sources that are adequate for our needs, but that won’t give us the excesses of concentrated energy with which we could do mischief to the earth or to each other.”

Very early anti-nuclear protests even demanded that we use coal instead of nuclear because coal is natural.

10/ As population grows, won’t we have to persuade humans to downgrade their aspirations and lower their living quality?

Absolutely not. I want to see all 8 billion humans on the planet living the life of, say, an upper middle-class Norwegian, and then some. It has been fantastic to see over the course of my life South Korea transform from an emerging or even developing economy into a technological and cultural giant, participating in the great global conversation of science and art. I cannot wait until the Nigerias, Indonesias, Vietnams and Egypts of the world—and all the other nations—do the same. Can you imagine what we’ll discover, what devices we’ll invent, what new medicines will extend and improve lives, what new styles of music we’ll listen to and art will beguile us when everyone on earth is released from poverty, drudgery and precarity?

As Stephen Jay Gould also put it: “I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.” The domination of those billions by other humans and by the rest of nature has been a tragedy both for those who are dominated and for everyone who isn’t and loses out on what they otherwise could have done. Oh what wonders humans will devise once we are all liberated!","March 31, 2023",Article,AEI,https://www.aei.org/articles/why-we-should-cheer-that-earths-population-just-passed-8-billion/
Don’t Ban Oil Exports to China,Benjamin Zycher,"Beltway silliness is as unavoidable as the summer humidity because rent-seeking groups, both economic and ideological, have powerful incentives to advocate legislation that would advance their interests at the expense of the economy in the aggregate. Nor is it difficult to find officeholders to make their arguments for them, even though, or perhaps because, they know better.

The rationales are almost always spurious. The latest example is the China Oil Export Prohibition Act of 2023, proposed by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), which would “amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prohibit exports of crude and refined oil and certain petroleum products to the People’s Republic of China.”

Rubio’s rationale is preposterous: “While gas prices soar across the country, the Biden Administration is allowing half a million barrels of American oil to go to China every day,” Rubio said. “This is unacceptable. We need to increase American oil production and give priority to domestic consumers, not send oil to a genocidal regime half a world away.”

Where to begin? A ban on oil exports to only one buyer would have trivial effects at most, in that market forces would reallocate all supplies globally, including those from the United States, so that prices would be equal across markets (adjusting for such minor factors as different transportation costs). Accordingly, U.S. exports would go to other countries, some of which then would sell the U.S. (or other) oil to China. What’s the point?

Rubio apparently believes simultaneously that banning oil exports to China would give “domestic consumers” price relief while also “increas[ing] American oil production.” Huh? Lower prices will lead to more production? In reality, his proposal would yield no price relief, as the reduction in U.S. exports would result in a reduction in U.S. output and/or a reduction in foreign exports to the U.S. But a longer-term decline in U.S. production would be likely, as the enactment of Rubio’s proposal would signal an increasingly hostile economic and policy environment for U.S. oil producers, with less investment a near-certainty. Can that outcome possibly be what Rubio wants?

Exports of liquefied natural gas to China are not constrained under the Rubio proposal, but there is no particular reason why they might not be included as the legislation evolves. After all, Rubio’s stated rationale above for a ban on oil exports to China could easily be expanded: Do we not want “to increase American [natural gas] production and give priority to domestic [natural gas] consumers?”

Many of those domestic consumers certainly want such a priority, as they believe, mistakenly, except perhaps in the short run, that such a ban would reduce the natural gas prices that they pay and thus yield an artificial competitive advantage for them in international competition. A good example is the Industrial Energy Consumers of America, a classic special-interest lobby seeking congressional favors for itself in the form of reductions in LNG exports at the expense of everyone else. IECA was preceded in this quest some years ago by America’s Energy Advantage, a group of petrochemical producers seeking reductions in LNG exports and also oblivious to the longer-term effects such policies would have on domestic investment, production, and prices. Some things in the Beltway truly are eternal.

Should Rubio’s bill gain traction, it is certain that a ban on LNG exports, whether to China alone or one more general, will be added. That is the nature of coalition politics, and with the division of Congress between the parties, some substantial Democratic buy-in will be needed. Rapidan Energy Group notes that “Democrats … could back a bill restricting LNG because … it would keep U.S. natural gas prices from rising compared to prices around the world, [and] it would hurt investment in the U.S. natural gas sector, supporting their decarbonization priorities.”

Rubio’s bill would entangle the Beltway more in the oil and gas sector. It would weaken the fundamental free-market argument that the government stay out of private-sector investment and contracting decisions except on the strongest national security grounds. And about the contracts that U.S. LNG companies have with Chinese buyers: Is it Rubio’s position that the federal government should simply abrogate them? Has he thought through the implications of this? Hint: What principle remains to oppose, say, a similar abrogation of existing permits for fossil-fuel production, even on private property?

Put aside the adverse impacts of Rubio’s bill, even as it would fail in its direct objectives. As a matter of principle and in terms of its larger implications, it is a monstrosity in the making. It should be defeated.","March 28, 2023",Article,AEI,https://www.aei.org/articles/dont-ban-oil-exports-to-china/
The Energy Transition Is a Delusion Indeed,"Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison","The “energy transition” continues to receive thunderous applause from all the usual Beltway suspects, an exercise in groupthink fantasy amazing to behold. For those with actual lives to live and thus uninterested in silliness: The “energy transition” is a massive shift, wholly artificial and politicized, from conventional energy inexpensive (Table 1b and here), reliable, and very clean given the proper policy environment, toward such unconventional energy technologies as wind and solar power. They are expensive, unreliable, and deeply problematic environmentally in terms of toxic metal pollution, wildlife destruction, land use massive and unsightly, emissions of conventional pollutants, and in a larger context large and inexorable reductions in aggregate wealth and thus the social willingness to invest in environmental protection.

But the Beltway being what it is, the fantasists are impervious to reality, until the massive costs and dislocations and absurdities become impossible to ignore. (Witness, for example, California.) Even as they backtrack on their confident assertions that a modern economy can be powered with the energy equivalent of pixie dust, they argue that the emerging problems are little more than growing pains attendant upon short run rigidities, and all will be well given some more time, more subsidies, and more magical thinking.

Uh, no. The obstacles confronting the “energy transition” are fundamental — they are caused by the very nature of unconventional energy — driven by massive costs, technical and engineering realities, severe constraints in terms of needed physical inputs, and at a political level growing local opposition to the unconventional energy facilities central to the “transition.”

These realities — there’s that word again — are discussed in detail in a major recent paper by Mark P. Mills of the Manhattan Institute. This brief discussion cannot do it justice, but let us first quote Mills directly:

In these circumstances, policymakers are beginning to grasp the enormous difficulty of replacing even a mere 10% share of global hydrocarbons—the share supplied by Russia—never mind the impossibility of trying to replace all of society’s use of hydrocarbons with solar, wind, and battery (SWB) technologies. Two decades of aspirational policies and trillions of dollars in spending, most of it on SWB tech, have not yielded an “energy transition” that eliminates hydrocarbons. Regardless of climate-inspired motivations, it is a dangerous delusion to believe that spending yet more, and more quickly, will do so. The lessons of the recent decade make it clear that SWB technologies cannot be surged in times of need, are neither inherently “clean” nor even independent of hydrocarbons, and are not cheap.

Mills makes a number of hard realities clear, among which are the following:

The realities of the physics, engineering, and economics of energy systems are independent of any beliefs about climate change.

Europe, the U.S. and Canada, Australia and the other regions that have pursued power grids with a higher share of wind and solar electricity uniformly have experienced large increases in electricity costs, and even that effect hides the costs of the massive subsidies borne by taxpayers.

It costs at least $30 to store the energy equivalent of one barrel of oil using lithium batteries, which explains why batteries cannot compensate for the unreliable nature of wind and solar power even for days, let alone weeks. “There is no physics, never mind engineering or economies of scale” that would overcome this cost disadvantage.

The time cost alone of recharging an electric vehicle makes such vehicles uncompetitive, even apart from the costs of the batteries and other problems.

The International Energy Agency estimates that only a partial energy transition would require increases in the supplies of lithium, graphite, nickel, and rare earths by 4,200%, 2,500%, 1,900%, and 700%, respectively, by 2040. This staggering problem of materials is “inherent in the nature of SWB technologies,” which means that the cost of unconventional energy will rise even more.

Nonetheless, the delusions continue. Mr. Amos Hochstein, an official at the Department of State, testified before a Senate committee recently that “The imperative [is] to diversify away from Russian energy dependence while accelerating the clean energy transition,” and that “The most effective way to reduce demand for Russian fossil fuels is to reduce dependence on all fossil fuels.”

Got that? Were the Europeans to reduce their dependence upon unreliable deliveries of Russian natural gas, and increase their dependence upon unconventional energy even more unreliable, there will result an increase in European “energy security.” Wow.

Comment to the Council on Environmental Quality: Interim Guidance on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change Under the National Environmental Policy Act,Benjamin Zycher,"Summary

Anthropogenic climate change is “real” in the sense that the effects of increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are observable in the data. But notwithstanding the CEQ assertions about a climate “crisis” and similar parameters, there is no evidence of any such “crisis,” however defined, in the data on temperatures, cyclones, sea levels, and any other climate phenomena. Moreover, CEQ shunts aside the difficult problem of separating the relative magnitudes of anthropogenic and natural influences on changes in climate parameters, implying without quite saying explicitly that natural influences are unimportant. The failure to address the sharp warming of 1910-1945 is only one of many problems with the approach adopted by CEQ in the Interim Guidance.

Instead, CEQ relies upon the analyses published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program in its National Climate Assessments, which are not to be taken seriously in that they rely upon climate models that cannot predict the past or the present, GHG emission/concentration assumptions that are not tenable, and an assumed inability of individuals and markets to adapt to changes in localized climate conditions.

Notwithstanding the CEQ allusions to “reasonably foreseeable GHG emissions that contribute to climate change,” the reality is that projects subject to review by federal agencies under the National Environmental Policy Act would have future climate impacts indistinguishable from zero, under any set of assumptions as applied to the Environmental Protection Agency climate model. Because of this obvious truth, CEQ makes no assertions about such future climate impacts, instructing agencies instead to apply the available estimates of the social cost of carbon to the asserted reductions in GHG emissions yielded by the project reviews; it is obvious that the Interagency Working Group estimates, when finalized, will serve that purpose, in that no federal agency will be able to employ an estimate of the SCC higher or lower than that asserted by the IWG. The IWG estimates are deeply flawed, in that they (1) distort the actual economic growth predictions produced by the Integrated Assessment Models, (2) base predictions of future climate phenomena on climate models that cannot predict the past or the present, (3) incorporate “co-benefits” in the form of a reduction in the emissions of other criteria and hazardous air pollutants already regulated under different provisions of the Clean Air Act, (4) incorporate the asserted benefits of GHG reductions on a global basis, and (5) employ discount rates that are inconsistent and inappropriate.

The CEQ admonition that agencies apply the Interim Guidance immediately “while CEQ seeks public comment on the guidance. CEQ intends to either revise the guidance in response to public comments or finalize the interim guidance” is disingenuous. It is obvious that CEQ has no intention of “revis[ing] the guidance in response to public comments” or for any other reason, other than perhaps in the most minor of dimensions. Why else would CEQ find it appropriate for “agencies [to] make use of it immediately”? Agency actions or inactions would have no effect on climate phenomena; accordingly, what is the hurry?



Moreover, the “environmental justice” assertions in the Interim Guidance are devoid of analytic content, shunting aside the reality that lower-income individuals, households, and groups consume less health and less environmental quality in all of their various dimensions, precisely because of that very lower income; and nowhere to be found in the CEQ discussion of “environmental justice” is there a consideration of the adverse but differing economic impacts of climate policies on various income groups.

The Interim Guidance is analytically flawed, inconsistent with the data, and fundamentally dishonest. It should not be finalized in this form or any other even remotely approximating it.

Biden’s Interior Department Keeps Dragging Its Feet on Offshore Leasing,"Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison","Notwithstanding some recent declines, domestic crude oil prices in the U.S. are about 45% higher than when President Biden was inaugurated. Global crude oil prices are about 48% higher. U.S. gasoline prices are about a dollar higher per gallon. Indeed, between the inauguration and June 2022, gasoline prices more than doubled. These prices began to increase almost monotonically long before the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

It is the hostility of the Biden administration toward domestic fossil-fuel production that is the actual source of these price dynamics. That stance portends less future domestic production, and less global production due to higher costs. (The very fact that the fossil fuel industry prefers to expand production in the U.S. rather than elsewhere demonstrates a belief that the incremental costs of the former are lower.)

The most recent manifestation of that hostility is the new five-year plan for leasing in federal waters on the Outer Continental Shelf, for the 2023-2028 period. Consider this explicit parameter in the plan (emphasis added):

… this Proposed Program includes, for further analysis and public comment, a range of potential OCS oil and gas lease sales from zero lease sales anywhere on the OCS to up to ten potential sales in the Gulf of Mexico Region Program Area 1 (i.e., up to two annual sales) and one potential lease sale in the northern portion of the Cook Inlet Program Area offshore south-central Alaska.

Accordingly, zero leasing is an explicit possibility. Consider the reality that the time lag between acquisition of a lease and actual production is between seven and ten years, needed for preliminary geologic investigation, three-dimensional seismic analysis, scheduling of a drilling rig and completion of an exploratory well, drilling and testing of additional exploratory and boundary definition wells, and the installation of ancillary facilities. Oh, and there also is the permitting process; a lease is not a permit, and the process is not simple and brief.

The explicit possibility of zero leasing is deeply problematic in terms of advance planning for the fossil producers. They cannot bid on proposed lease sites without advance analysis, which is very far from cheap, and the possibility of zero lease sales makes any such expenditures highly risky. Can anyone be surprised that this possibility will reduce both the number of sites of interest and the dollar magnitude of the bids?

It is instructive to compare the federal OCS lease numbers for the first two years of all administrations going back to the Kennedy years. The Biden administration has made two lease offerings; the average since the Kennedy administration is five. The number of tracts leased, respectively: 307 and 733. Millions of acres leased, respectively: 1.7 and 3.8.

Fossil fuels are one important form of national wealth; artificial constraints on producing it make that wealth smaller, an outcome that imposes real costs upon actual people. Competitive market forces drive the allocation of that wealth among landowners, producers, workers, and myriad other individuals and groups contributing to the production of fossil fuels from the federal OCS. The Biden hostility to fossil production and the unsubtle effort to suppress leasing will impose losses upon the taxpayers who are the ultimate beneficiaries (“owners”) of lease payments and royalties derived from fossil production from the OCS.

The Biden administration is desperate to pretend that none of these adverse outcomes — less national wealth and higher energy costs — are the result of its policies. Instead, the excuses began almost immediately. It was Vladimir Putin’s fault, despite the fact that prices already had increased by about half before the Ukraine invasion. The fossil producers are engaged in “price gouging” and “profiteering,” an argument rather silly in that the international market for crude oil and refined products is largely competitive; such purported profiteering in one market can be predicted to induce an increase in gasoline exports to that market by exporters attempting to capture such high prices for themselves.

Then there is the argument that oil producers are allowing “9,000” approved leases on federal land to go unused. Because there are about 37,500 leases in effect, a 76% utilization rate would be a historic high. Many leases are mired in litigation by environmental groups aligned politically with the administration. Horizontal drilling means that individual leases are not usable without a geographic leasehold that is complete, and the Biden hostility to leasing exacerbates this problem.

The latest OCS proposed leasing program is perverse: It will contribute to higher energy costs, smaller economic returns for taxpayers and the economy as a whole, and it will yield no environmental benefits. Indeed, to the extent that overseas production of fossil fuels replaces forgone domestic production, global environmental quality will decline because U.S. environmental standards are the best in the world. The proposed OCS leasing program is woefully deficient, as it is all cost and no benefit. It should be readdressed and restructured completely.","March 06, 2023",Article,AEI,https://www.aei.org/articles/bidens-interior-department-keeps-dragging-its-feet-on-offshore-leasing/
Letter: Schumer’s “Free-Market” Defense of ESG Falls Flat,"Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison","Note: This letter to the editor appeared in the Wall Street Journal on March 2, 2023, in response to the Journal’s March 1, 2023, op-ed titled “Republicans Ought to Be All for ESG.”

Sen. Chuck Schumer argues in favor of a regulation explicitly allowing retirement-fund managers to include environmental, social and governance objectives as investment criteria, maintaining that ESG factors “minimize risk and maximize their clients’ returns” (“Republicans Ought to Be All for ESG,” op-ed, March 1). Oh, please. ESG criteria, among which are disinvestment from industries purportedly contributing to the climate “crisis,” charitable donations to community (leftist) groups, and identity-group representation on corporate boards, are necessarily political. They allow fund managers to substitute their political preferences in place of the fiduciary interests of plan participants under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that the insertion of nonpecuniary investment criteria imposes a substantial penalty over time in terms of realized returns. This isn’t surprising: The criteria impose artificial constraints on investment choices. Far from being a way to “let the market work,” ESG in reality is the most recent version of the timeless game of “Other People’s Money.”

Emission Cuts Will Fail to Stop Climate Change. What to Do Then?,Tunku Varadarajan,"Bellevue, Wash.

Sometimes it takes a visionary to throw cold water on a seemingly revolutionary development. When scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieved a breakthrough in December—producing more energy in a fusion reaction than they used to ignite it—the Biden administration hyped the experiment as a quantum leap for its green agenda. “This milestone,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm boasted, “moves us one significant step closer to the possibility of zero-carbon abundant fusion energy powering our society.”

Not so fast, says Nathan Myhrvold, one of America’s most versatile applied scientists and inventors. “While I hope to see affordable fusion reactors in my lifetime,” he says, “I’m not holding my breath.” (He’s 63.) The machine at the National Ignition Facility was designed to make “at most a few bright flashes of raw energy a day. That’s it. Not to capture the energy, not to turn it into electricity.” He says it’s “sort of like those spectacular gasoline explosions you see in the movies when they blow up a car.” It’s a “long, long road” from there to an internal-combustion engine that “converts thousands of controlled gasoline explosions into useful energy every second.”

Make no mistake—Mr. Myhrvold is concerned about climate change. But he’s a scientific realist who thinks the shibboleths on the subject—embodied in such documents as the Paris Agreement of 2016—are misbegotten. Mankind isn’t capable of reducing emissions enough to keep temperatures from rising unacceptably.

"Comment to the Environmental Protection Agency: Proposed Rule on Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review",Benjamin Zycher,"Summary

Notwithstanding the repeated assertions in the proposed rule that implementation would yield significant benefits in terms of reducing anthropogenic climate change, a straightforward application of the EPA climate model — under a highly favorable set of assumptions that exaggerate the effects of reduced GHG emissions — predicts that the temperature impact of the proposed rule in 2100 would be about 0.0029°C, that is, about 29 ten-thousandths of one degree. As the standard deviation of the surface temperature record is about 0.11°C, that effect would not be detectable.

EPA attempts to circumvent this obvious problem by shunting aside the prospective effects of its proposed rule — even as predicted by its own climate model — by multiplying its asserted reductions in methane emissions by the Interagency Working Group interim estimates of the social cost of carbon/methane (and other greenhouse gases). That SCC estimate is deeply problematic for a number of reasons, among which are (1) a distortion of the actual economic growth predictions produced by the IAMs, (2) predictions of future climate phenomena based upon climate models that cannot predict the past or the present, (3) the incorporation of “co-benefits” in the form of a reduction in the emissions of other criteria and hazardous air pollutants already regulated under different provisions of the Clean Air Act, and (4) the use of inappropriate discount rates.

Notwithstanding the EPA justification of the proposed rule as a tool with which to “mitigate climate-destabilizing pollution and protect human health by reducing” GHG emissions, the large body of evidence on trends in climate phenomena does not support the characterization of methane (or other GHG) as “climate-destabilizing.”

Comment Letter: Federal Acquisitions Regulation Disclosure of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate-Related Financial Risk Proposed Rule,Benjamin Zycher,"Editor’s note: This comment is responding to a combined rule-making effort by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

Summary

No federal supplier is capable of conducting the “physical risk” or “transition risk” analyses required under tis proposed regulation. The former would involve complex choices among climate models, alternative emissions/concentration scenarios, assumptions on such hugely complex issues as the sensitivity of the climate system, issues with respect to how to disaggregate the analysis by sector and geographic region, and many others. Even governments and international organizations wholly dedicated to such analysis find the needed analytic efforts daunting. The latter would require projections of political outcomes and policy choices decades into the future. Both “risk” analyses are essentially impossible, and any ensuing conclusions about “risks” should not be taken seriously.

Climate “risks” are far from the only geographic- and sector-specific risks that are both large and low in probability. A focus on only one among them will yield a misallocation of capital and increased costs for federal taxpayers. Moreover, any such analysis of climate “risks” will be driven to use one of the conventional climate models — the EPA model in particular — that have not been shown to be capable of predicting the actual temperature record without substantial upward biases.

The large body of evidence on climate phenomena is inconsistent with the implicit assumption of a looming climate “crisis” underlying the Agencies proposed regulation. The Agencies assume explicitly a “transition to a lower-carbon economy” that has proven enormously expensive even in its earlier stages, in all the geographic regions and national economies in which it has been adopted — even with massive subsidies and other subventions and favoritism — and, accordingly, the Agencies are assuming the future answer to the ongoing and future policy question. This is a poor and indeed highly “risky” framework for current policymaking.

The premise in the proposed regulation that GHG emissions by federal contractors matter nontrivially in the context of anthropogenic climate change is preposterous. Under highly favorable assumptions about the emissions attendant upon federal procurement, an immediate reduction in those emissions by half would reduce global temperatures in 2100 by 0.013°C, an effect that is an order of magnitude smaller than the standard deviation of the surface temperature record. The proposed regulation cannot satisfy any plausible benefit/cost test.

Because there is no statutory authority for the proposed regulation, and because it allows international non-governmental organizations to define procedural requirements for the measurement, disclosure, and estimation tasks for emissions, “risks,” and reduction targets, it is blatantly unconstitutional. More narrowly, it is inconsistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.

By exempting tribes, non-profit organizations, universities, state and local governments, and “entities deriving at least 80 percent of annual revenue from federal management and operating contracts,” the proposed regulation has far less to do with “science” than with political favoritism toward specific interest groups. The Agencies should not finalize this proposed rule.

Comment to the Environmental Protection Agency: Proposed Rule Renewable Fuel Standard Program Standards for 2023-2025 and Other Changes,Benjamin Zycher,"Summary

The proposed rule for renewable fuels standards and requirements derives its estimates from the Interagency Working Group interim updated estimates of the social cost of carbon, which are the arithmetic result of a series of deeply dubious assumptions and methodologies, then multiplied by the asserted effects of the RFS requirements in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The analytic problems inherent in the IWG methodology are legion, but prominent among them are an indifference to the available analysis projecting that changes in climate phenomena would have very small economic effects, reliance upon climate models that have overstated the actual satellite temperature record by a factor approaching 2.5, the use of discount rates inappropriately low, and a number of others.

More fundamentally, that methodology employed in the proposed rule is fatally flawed, as it shunts aside in wholesale fashion the prospective effects upon actual climate phenomena, as predicted in the Environmental Protection Agency climate model used by the entire federal government for regulatory analysis. Under a series of highly favorable assumptions applied to the EPA’s own estimates in the proposed rule and Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis, that model predicts that the reduction in global temperatures in 2100 would be 0.023°C, an effect that would not be detectable. The entire net-zero policy now being pursued by the Biden administration if achieved immediately under these assumptions would reduce global temperatures in 2100 by 0.173°C.

Accordingly, the use of the purported social cost of carbon as a parameter underlying the asserted “climate benefits” of the proposed rule is preposterous. The proposed RFS requirements would yield climate impacts effectively equal to zero even under all the other assumptions incorporated into the EPA analysis.

The asserted “energy security” benefits of the proposed rule are illusory, a reality conceded implicitly by the EPA itself in the DRIA. Because there can be only one world market price for such fungible commodities as crude oil, abstracting from such second-order differences as transportation costs, exchange rate impacts, and the like, nations that import all of their oil face the same prices and price changes as those importing none of their oil. Accordingly, the common view of “energy security” as a direct result of the level or proportion of imports is incorrect; but the EPA endorses this view nonetheless. A U.S. that imports more oil is not less “energy secure” than a U.S. that imports less.

The queues and market disruptions experienced in the U.S. in 1973 did not result from the oil “embargo” imposed by Arab OPEC and directed at the U.S., the Netherlands, and a few others. Instead, it was the imposition of price and allocation controls and other regulatory rigidities and constraints that yielded the market dislocations. Note that there was no “embargo” in 1979; but there was a production cutback in the wake of the Iranian revolution, higher international prices, the re-imposition of price and allocation regulations in the U.S. market, and resulting queues and market dislocations. “Energy security” is an attribute of liquid fuels reflected fully in market prices. Accordingly, the purported “energy security” benefits of the RFS program are an illusion.

Because the market is fully capable of anticipating and investing in preparation in advance of supply disruptions, the discussion of the SPR in the DRIA is confused. Market prices unconstrained by regulatory distortions provide efficient incentives for such preparation; it is the threat of price controls and “windfall profits” taxes and other such policies that are likely to yield investment in private sector preparation smaller than economically efficient in the aggregate. Accordingly, the costs of the SPR are the direct result of adverse government policies anticipated with some nontrivial probability; that the DRIA then attempts to justify the costs of the RFS on the basis of SPR costs created by the government itself is perverse.



Similarly, the defense cost argument is misguided. The portion of the costs of the U.S. defense effort that can be attributed to defense of the sea lanes and the like is a hugely complex analytic calculation, dependent upon a large array of alternative assumptions about the allocation of the fixed costs of the physical and human force structures across military functions and missions. Because national security needs and force structures evolve only over decades, it is reasonable as a first approximation to assume that defense capital provides those multiple functions in more-or-less fixed proportions, which means that any allocation of those fixed costs across multiple functions is arbitrary. Accordingly, the analysis of the purported benefits of the RFS program in terms of an asserted reduction in (long-run) defense costs is illusory. The DRIA has not demonstrated that the costs of the RFS attributable to a reduction in prospective defense costs are lower than the costs of the U.S. defense effort attributable to defense of the sea lanes and other such missions. This component of the DRIA is not to be taken seriously.

The “environmental justice” justifications for the RFS as presented in the DRIA are very poor conceptually. Environmental justice typically is defined in terms of differing levels of environmental quality experienced by various groups, the poor and minority groups in particular. This basic framework is largely incorrect, or at least too narrow: Environmental quality is one of many component of “health” broadly defined, and it is clear from the scholarly literature that “health” is a “normal” good, that is, one the consumption of which rises with income or wealth. This is true for individuals and for economies as a whole. Accordingly, the “environmental justice” issue as usually formulated boils down to a complaint that there are poor people in this world who consume less environmental quality than others, that is, that they choose to allocate their resources in ways different from those exhibited by individuals and households wealthier.

The analysis underlying the proposed rule is fatally flawed; it should not be finalized as proposed.

Comment to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions,"Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison, James W. Coleman","Summary

The draft principles published by the Fed for the evaluation by Fed-supervised financial institutions of climate-related physical and transition risks are fatally flawed, and should be withdrawn. The Fed assumes physical risks that are not consistent with the body of evidence on climate phenomena, and a prospective evolution of climate-related public policies that at most are highly unlikely to be implemented and in reality would prove virtually impossible to implement. Moreover, financial institutions, however large, are incapable of conducting the requisite analysis of future climate phenomena — even the Federal government cannot do so in a way that is consistent with the data — with respect to which the scientific uncertainties are vastly greater than commonly asserted. With respect to the transition (policy-related) risks noted by the Fed in its draft principles: The evaluation of such risks would require speculation about the evolution of political conditions and public policies that would be almost wholly speculative. Moreover, the overwhelming body of evidence suggests strongly that the “transition to a lower-carbon economy” would prove hugely expensive, so that the almost-explicit Fed assumption that such a “transition” is a virtual certainty is not to be taken seriously.

The range of alternative assumptions about central parameters is too great to yield clear implications for the climate “risks” facing specific financial institutions, economic sectors, and geographic regions. Those central parameters include the choices among climate models, the assumed sensitivity of the climate system to increases in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG), ensuing conclusions about the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic influences upon climate phenomena, the assumed future increase in atmospheric GHG concentrations through, say, 2100, and the analytic assumptions underlying calculations of the effects of aerosol emissions on cloud formation, about which surprisingly little is known. That short list is far from exhaustive.

If large financial institutions banks are driven to use the same (or similar) sets of assumptions about central parameters, a very real danger would arise of more-or-less homogeneous predictions inconsistent with historical, ongoing, and prospective climate phenomena. If they opt to use sets of assumptions that differ in important dimensions, the ensuing predictions about future climate phenomena (“risks”) would vary substantially, yielding very large uncertainties in terms of the information made available to investors and regulators.

It is reasonable to hypothesize that financial institutions driven to evaluate climate “risks” will have powerful incentives to undertake climate analysis driven not by the actual evidence and the peer-reviewed literature on climate phenomena. Instead, they will be driven to undertake such analysis, whether in response to regulatory directives or to political pressures, under assumptions and methodologies insulating them from adverse regulatory actions, litigation threats, and political pressures.

It is reasonable to hypothesize also that the aggregate, sectoral, and geographic benefits (that is, positive “risks”) of increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG), as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and in the peer-reviewed literature, will be excluded from such analytic efforts.

The proposed requirement for the analysis of “transition risks” assumes a “transition” away from fossil fuels that is very likely to border on the impossible as a matter of economic feasibility. In any event, any such analysis of “transition risk” must be based upon predictions of the future evolution of energy and other policies over decades, an exercise in political prognostication that no financial institution, however large — indeed that anyone — is in a position to undertake in a fashion that is not wholly speculative.

Because the perceived “climate “risks” confronting financial institutions are dependent upon crucial choices among alternative assumptions, the evaluation of such “risks” would be largely arbitrary given that the “correct” assumptions are very far from obvious. A misallocation of capital is a likely result, which means that a requirement that climate “risks” be evaluated would be likely to weaken the pursuit of the safety, soundness, and systemic stability objectives that are the formal mandates for the Fed.

When “risk” analysis becomes an arbitrary function of choices among assumptions complex, opaque, and far from obvious, the traditional safety, soundness, and systemic stability objectives that are the formal mandates for the Fed inexorably will be diluted and rendered far less useful for the investment and capital markets, an outcome diametrically at odds with the ostensible objectives of those advocating the evaluation of climate “risks.” Moreover, the “risks” of anthropogenic climate change are far from the only such mass-geography “risks.” A bias toward focusing only on climate “risks” would distort the allocation of capital.

The combination of very great climate uncertainties and litigation and regulatory threats will create a demand from the banking sector for detailed regulations on how to structure the analysis of climate risks. Because the uncertainties attendant upon the future effects of increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHG are so great, a top-down regulatory approach for the evaluation of any attendant “risks” is itself very risky. A wiser approach would entail allowing market forces to make such “risk” determinations in a bottom-up fashion, thus avoiding an obvious politicization of the allocation of capital. A Fed mandate that large banks evaluate climate “risks” represents a blatant effort to distort the allocation of capital away from economic sectors disfavored by certain political interest groups pursuing ideological agendas. This would represent the return of Operation Choke Point, a past attempt to politicize access to capital, one deeply corrosive of our legal and constitutional institutions.

Protection of those institutions is consistent only with formal policymaking by the Congress through enactment of legislation, rather than with powerful pressures, whether formal or informal, exerted by regulatory agencies. This institutional protection would preserve the traditional roles of the private sector and of the government, respectively, as part of the larger permanent objectives of maximizing the productivity of resource use under free market competition, and of preserving the political accountability of the policymaking process under the institutions of democratic decisionmaking as constrained by the constitution.

"Balloons, Beijing, Biden, and Blinken","Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison","This post is in response to Press Coverage, Not the Spy Balloon, Forced Biden to Cancel Blinken’s China Jaunt by Andrew C. McCarthy

Andrew McCarthy is absolutely correct in his observation that “the Biden administration postponed Blinken’s trip because the press began reporting that the spy balloon entered into American air space.” And he is correct that “the administration had every intention of . . . having Blinken go to China to project the illusion of thawing U.S.-China relations.”

But I think McCarthy buries the lede when he concludes that had the balloon “not been noticed by enough members of the public that it was reported by the press, the American secretary of state would be gladhanding in Beijing today even as China’s surveillance aircraft was lolling over our homeland and defense facilities.” Can it possibly be the case that no one in the White House or the State Department or the National Security Council recognized the very real possibility that the balloon would be seen widely and reported while Blinken was in Beijing? What would the administration have done then?

Amazingly, it appears that this political danger escaped attention, even though it was obvious, immediate, and far from trivial. This continues a pattern: The administration does not or cannot see beyond the daily news cycle, shunting aside obvious looming problems with substantial likelihoods of creating headaches in the not-too-distant future. Release crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in a futile attempt to moderate gasoline prices? What will happen to prices when the SPR has to be replenished? Take no action when Salman Rushdie is attacked on American soil as a manifestation of Iranian policy? What perverse incentives does that strengthen? Ignore the overwhelming evidence from Europe on the costs of unconventional energy? What will happen here if we continue to pursue the same path?

All administrations are driven by the news cycle toward varying degrees of myopia, but it is clear that the Biden administration is in a class by itself in this context.

"Comment to the Department of the Interior: Proposed Rule on Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation","Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison, James W. Coleman","Summary

The definition of “wasted” natural gas in the proposed rule is divorced from considerations of economic efficiency, and even given the various estimates delineated in the proposed rule, it cannot satisfy any plausible benefit/cost test in terms of the costs and value of reductions in methane emissions from production operations on federal lands. Accordingly, the assertion in the proposed rule that “the requirements of this proposed rule reflect reasonable measures to avoid waste that could be expected of a prudent operator” is preposterous. The circumvention of this obvious problem in the proposed rule through an application of the IWG estimate of the social cost of methane is deeply dubious, a reality made clear by a straightforward application of the EPA climate model.

The promulgation of the requirements in the proposed rule would reduce bids for leases on federal lands, and perhaps exploration and production activities as well, because prospective operators will not fail to reduce their bids in the face of increased costs and required royalty payments. Accordingly, the real “wasted” gas will be that otherwise efficient to produce that will remain in the ground because of perverse regulatory constraints leading operators not to produce it.

Comment to the Environmental Protection Agency: Proposed Phasedown of Hydrofluorocarbons,"Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison","Summary

The Environmental Protection Agency proposed rule on refrigerants is fatally flawed analytically, and if finalized would impose large net costs upon the U.S. economy generally and upon lower-income groups and households in particular. EPA provides estimates of the reduction in GHG emissions that would result from implementation of the proposed rule, but ignores the prospective climate impacts of that asserted reduction, substituting instead the deeply dubious interim calculation of the SCC from the Interagency Working Group multiplied by the asserted GHG reduction. That methodology is invalid, and in any event an application of the EPA climate model demonstrates that the actual climate effects of the proposed rule would be indistinguishable from zero under any set of plausible assumptions.

The EPA use of inconsistent discount rates to evaluate the asserted benefits and costs of the proposed rule is invalid, and the EPA justification for doing so on grounds of intergenerational equity is both fundamentally incorrect and would harm future generations by yielding a bequest of an aggregate capital stock smaller than otherwise would be the case. Moreover, the use of a discount rate artificially low only for the benefit side of the benefit/cost analysis of climate policies would yield important biases not only for resource allocation across the economy as a whole, but also for the evaluation of the relative merits of alternative policy initiatives of the federal government taken alone.

The EPA assertion of cost savings from the proposed rule is preposterous, based upon assertions and assumptions from industry participants for whom the proposed rule would engender a competitive advantage. More generally, EPA fails to explain why market forces have failed to move toward the refrigerant substitution envisioned in the proposed rule if indeed there are substantial cost savings combined with little or no decline in the quality of refrigeration services. The EPA benefit/cost analysis is deeply unserious, and cannot provide a sound basis for policymaking.

The EPA arguments on “environmental justice” are fatally flawed, in that they ignore the greater burden of increased air conditioning costs upon lower-income groups and households, and more generally because they ignore the reality that lower-income groups and households simply by virtue of their income status consume less “health” in all of its many dimensions. Accordingly, the “environmental justice” issue as usually formulated boils down to a complaint that there are poor people in this world who consume less environmental quality than others, that is, that they choose to allocate their resources in ways different from those exhibited by individuals and households wealthier.

The EPA assertions about the climate impacts of increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHG are wholly inconsistent with the evidence. The proposed rule is fatally flawed in its assumptions and analyses, and should not be finalized.

Observations on the Third Order Draft of the Fifth National Climate Assessment,"Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison","Summary

The Third Order Draft of the Fifth National Climate Assessment is a fatally-flawed document offering a discussion of climate science and policy divorced from the data, inconsistent with the dominant climate model employed by the federal government, and dangerous in its disregard for the institutions of democratic governance as constrained by the U.S. constitution. It is, therefore, a deeply politicized analytic exercise. The U.S. Global Change Research Program should abandon this draft in favor of a complete revision not characterized by these problems.

The NCA5 asserts that almost all observed changes in temperatures and other climate phenomena are anthropogenic in origin. That is simply false. The NCA5 asserts that climate phenomena both extreme and dangerous are increasing. That is simply false. The NCA5 asserts that reductions in U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will yield important improvements in the prospective dynamics of climate phenomena. That is not consistent with the predictions generated by the Environmental Protection Agency climate model, under assumptions that exaggerate the future predicted effects of reduced emissions. The NCA5 asserts that the costs of unconventional energy to be substituted in place of conventional energy are “rapidly falling.” Even if true — a premise that is very far from obviously correct — it is irrelevant, in that the “rapidly falling” costs of unconventional energy remain profoundly uncompetitive with conventional energy on a cost basis, as reported by the Energy Information Administration. That massive subsidies and other subventions are required to increase the market shares of unconventional energy technologies demonstrates this reality.

The various socioeconomic passages in the NCA5, which can be subsumed under the heading “environmental justice,” are very poor analytically, and a more-rigorous reflection leads to the conclusion that the campaign for “environmental justice” is little more than a complaint that there are low- and lower-income people in America who consume less health in all of its various dimensions, one of which is environmental quality. Moreover, the costs of goods and services confronting different socioeconomic groups is a crucial component of “environmental justice,” and the data are unambiguous that increases in energy costs yield adverse effects far more serious for lower income groups than for others.

The NCA5 examines the hypothetical effects of several scenarios detailed in the 4th and 5th Assessment Reports published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but nowhere does NCA5 discuss the relative likelihoods of those scenarios. The peer-reviewed literature reports that the scenarios yielding the most adverse future climate impacts are the lowest in probability, and the most extreme among the scenarios is virtually impossible. Moreover, the economic analysis underlying the most extreme among the scenarios is very poor, but NCA5 employs it nonetheless.

Notwithstanding the dire assertions on food production and availability made in the NCA5, the data on global per capita food production are highly favorable, and display no adverse relationship to atmospheric concentrations of GHG. Finally, the assertions in the NCA5 about U.S. national and international “commitments” for reductions in GHG emissions are profoundly incorrect as a legal matter, and represent a serious threat to the constitutional institutions of U.S. governance, and therefore to the constitutional protection of the freedom of Americans.

Don’t Foul Up the Federal Supply Chain with Global Warming Nonsense,"Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison","For the Biden administration, climate is everything, and everything is climate. The latest example of this single-minded obsession is a proposed amendment to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that would require “certain Federal contractors disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risk and set science-based targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.”

The proposed regulation cites four executive orders as authority; no actual law is cited, demonstrating the absence of statutory authority for this effort to insert climate politics into the complex acquisition systems for major parts of the federal government. The relevant law is the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, the purpose of which “is to provide the Federal Government with an economical and efficient system” for “procuring and supplying property and nonpersonal services, and performing related functions.”

Even just the measurement of greenhouse emissions is no simple task. The estimation of “climate-related financial risk” is a hugely complex analytic exercise fraught with uncertainties and beyond the capabilities of any contractor or supplier and, for that matter, the federal government itself. Precisely how are federal contractors and suppliers to choose among the hundred-plus climate models, among the hugely complex assumptions underlying their projections, and among the conflicting “science-based” future effects of GHG reductions on a sector-by-sector basis? And about those “science-based” reductions: Reductions in greenhouse emissions by federal contractors would yield future climate effects effectively equal to zero, using the Environmental Protection Agency climate model.

And so, this effort to distort the federal supply chain would be all cost and no benefit, even under the assumptions underlying the proposal. Benefits for taxpayers from an economical and efficient procurement system? Who cares about them?

It gets much worse. The proposed rule allows international nongovernmental organizations — the Science-Based Targets Initiative, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, and CDP Disclosure Insight Action — to define the procedural requirements for the measurement, disclosure, and estimation tasks for emissions, “risks,” and reduction targets. It is inevitable that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will force its own preferences and requirements into the federal procurement system, a precedent carrying implications enormous and enormously destructive. Amazingly, the administration is proud of this. American sovereignty? What’s that?

In its desperation to lead the international climate industry and to curry favor with the interest groups ideologically opposed to fossil fuels, the administration has shunted aside the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, which provides that proposed rules be published in the Federal Register and that interested parties be given a meaningful opportunity to offer comments, to which the agency proposing the rule must respond. The APA says nothing about international NGOs, nor does the Constitution grant them any powers. Can anyone believe that the Biden administration cares one whit about the “consent of the governed” or that it has any sense at all about how very perverse such rules are for our system of constitutional constraints on government power?

It is no secret the Biden administration is implementing a massive climate-related regulatory onslaught. What will happen when (not if) this procurement rule conflicts with others promulgated by federal agencies? An example: the several definitional inconsistencies between this proposed rule and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed rule on disclosure of climate risks. What will happen when (not if) this procurement rule conflicts with the requirements defined by the very NGOs upon which the rule relies? An example: SBTi is immersed in an interminable process of defining emissions reductions for the fossil-fuel sector, and so it is unclear how those producers are to undertake compliance with the proposed Biden procurement rule, even if it were consistent with the Constitution and statutory law, which it is not.

That this proposed rule ignores science in favor of wholly political imperatives is illustrated by the fact that it exempts tribes, nonprofit organizations, universities, state and local governments, and “entities deriving at least 80% of annual revenue from federal management and operating contracts.” It is easy to predict that such exemptions will yield an artificial competitive advantage in federal contracting for those so favored, the net result of which might be future greenhouse emissions higher than otherwise would be the case. Is it “science,” or is it interest-group politics that is driving this?

Such are the fruits of climate as an ideological imperative overriding everything else. The courts might view this proposed rule unfavorably under the Major Questions Doctrine, and it should be rejected by the new Congress under the Congressional Review Act. Above all, as the massive costs created by the climate crusade become manifest, the voters, over time, will have to assert their interests.","January 25, 2023",Article,AEI,https://www.aei.org/articles/dont-foul-up-the-federal-supply-chain-with-global-warming-nonsense/
Earth overpopulation is a myth we should all ignore,Timothy P. Carney,"Fears of human overpopulation have been around for decades. Hollywood has even crafted dystopian thrillers like Soylent Green, Blade Runner and even Avengers: Infinity War around the dangers of overpopulation. But if this true, how does one explain China’s population decline in 2022? The concern is that with Earth’s population now at eight billion people, we won’t have enough resources for everyone. Straight Arrow News contributor Tim Carney says Earth overpopulation is a myth we should all ignore because the human population is actually declining.

Overpopulation. For our entire lives, we’ve been told that the earth is too crowded. But no matter how many times their dire warnings prove wrong, the anti-natalists seem to hold sway over American and European media.

A biologist named Paul Ehrlich published a book in 1968 titled “The Population Bomb,” which promised mass starvation thanks to an overpopulated planet. The next 55 years proved him fantastically wrong as the population increased, while human abundance – that is energy, food and jobs – also increased.

Yet in 2023, 60 Minutes had Ehrlich and other doomsayers on the air to warn once again that humanity is not sustainable. This time due to climate change. 60 Minutes and Paul Ehrlich are correct that there’s a real population bomb. But it’s not an explosion. It’s an implosion.

China’s government just reported that 9.6 million people were born in China last year, while 10.4 million died. China is depopulating and much of the rest of the world is, too. From 2012 to 2022, many countries in Eastern Europe lost population, as did Japan and Italy. Other countries will follow soon because every wealthy country in the world, besides Israel, has a birth rate below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman.

Countries with below-replacement birth rates will all start shrinking sooner or later. The U.S. for instance, has had a birth rate around 1.7 babies per woman for the last few years, and we’ve had fewer and fewer babies nearly every year since 2008. The baby bust is already showing up in schools. Elementary schools around the country have been shuttering for years due to lower enrollment. Middle schools followed, now the baby bust is entering high schools and colleges are bracing for a shrinking pool of potential applicants.

Already the working-age population in the U.S. seems to have peaked as more Baby Boomers enter retirement age than Gen-Zers age into the workforce. You can imagine where this is headed: More retirees and fewer workers, which is not a great situation. It means labor shortages and inflation, which means the government will push retirement dates later, and will try to coax more young adults into the full-time workforce. Which means fewer mothers and fathers dedicating time to their children, which means fewer children.

It’s a vicious cycle. Many countries, mostly in Africa, have birth rates about 2.1. But those birth rates are also falling. By the end of this century, the earth’s population will begin shrinking. And if that vicious cycle isn’t halted somehow, we will have generations of stagnation and sadness.

Planet Earth is not overpopulated. Our problem could be the exact opposite soon, unless we get busy trying to make America more child friendly and trying to remind people that on this earth, the most important thing is family.","January 19, 2023",Multimedia,AEI,https://www.aei.org/multimedia/earth-overpopulation-is-a-myth-we-should-all-ignore/
Letter: Cows Are Not Going to Solve Global Warming,"Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison","Note: This letter to the editor appeared in the Wall Street Journal on January 19, 2023 in response to the Journal’s January 17, 2023 op-ed titled “There’s a Climate Solution in Dairy Cows’ Stomachs.”

In “There’s a Climate Solution in Dairy Cows’ Stomachs” (op-ed, Jan. 17), Fred Krupp and Antoine de Saint-Affrique manage to get everything wrong. Agriculture contributes about a quarter, not a third, of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Global per capita food production increased 46% between 1961 and 2020, and 20% since 2000. The global number of undernourished people increased from 618 million in 2019 to 768 million in 2021, but to attribute this to climate change is preposterous. Covid and various wars and supply-chain problems were the problem. (In 2000, the number of undernourished people was 823 million, when the global population was 30% smaller.)

Atmospheric physicists William Happer and William van Wijngaarden have demonstrated that the current contribution of methane emissions to warming is only about a tenth of the small effect of carbon-dioxide emissions. If we assume the elimination of all methane emissions from global dairy operations—about 600 million tons annually—and apply the EPA climate model, the reduction in global temperatures in 2100 would be 13 one-thousandths of a degree, an effect that wouldn’t be detectable.

The assertion that the methane reductions will allow dairy producers to earn more profits is also deeply dubious. There are no free lunches.

Summary Observations on the Environmental Protection Agency Final Revised Definition of “Waters of the United States”: Statement Submitted to the Congressional Western Caucus,"Benjamin Zycher, Peter J. Wallison","The Clean Water Act of 1972 (CWA) fails to define the “Waters of the United States” with sufficient clarity to provide unambiguous guidance to landowners, state and local officials, regulators, and Article Three courts with respect to the relevant authorities and limits attendant upon the requirements of the CWA. The overarching long-term effect of that ambiguity is a permanent state of uncertainty confronting all interested parties. The CWA authorizes the regulation of private economic activity on the “navigable waters” of the United States. As that term is not self-defining, court decisions have expanded the definition of “navigable waters” to include bodies of water with a “significant nexus” to waters that actually are navigable, a redefinition that does not reduce the ambiguity inherent in the CWA, but that does enhance the asserted powers of government regulatory agencies to allocate resources generally and more directly to politicize the use of private property.
